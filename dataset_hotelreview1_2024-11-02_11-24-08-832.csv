An artful blend of contemporary architecture and the minimalistic style with an authentic Sri Lankan touch, the resort aims to provide the distinctive experience of a villager's uncomplicated lifestyle. Location - Sigiriya, Sri Lanka Accommodation Each chalet's chic yet simple structural design has been carefully planned to blend in with its natural surrounding and have been built to comply with green building guidelines on energy and environment. The resort consists of 96 rooms that come equipped with all modern comforts, illustrating a discreet opulence. These rooms have been uniquely designed with the colours and motifs of Sri Lankan batik with themes mostly inspired by the elephant, giving them an artistic appeal. In addition to the chalets, the resort accommodate 18 spacious luxury tents.","info.aliya@themacollection.com","4.5","This property is classified according to Giata.","4878877","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/71/7b/10/pool-view.jpg","Sri Lanka","false","7.999949",,"","Avudangawa, Central Province","80.73587","Aliya Resort & Spa","3467","96","+94 66 2 040400","4926","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/71/7b/10/pool-view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/7d/96/f4/main-entrance-n-colorful.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/f0/5c/96/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/3f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/3e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/43/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/3d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/42/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/3c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/eb/b2/40/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/27/99/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/27/19/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/5f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/5e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/5d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/61/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/60/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d4/26/5b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d2/a3/2b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b3/9c/09/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b3/9c/3f/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,"$$","$107 - $179","6","1","#1 of 6 hotels in Avudangawa","4.5","37","48","176","725","2481","4.786401748657227","2024-10-18T23:37:40-04:00","974484431","5","974484431","Main restaurant is the best for dining.","room_tip",,"2024-10-03T08:33:50-04:00","972420279","5","972420279","Start your mornings early and take a stroll  among the beautiful trees .","room_tip",,"2024-10-01T06:44:24-04:00","972154797","5","972154797","Excellent place to stay.","room_tip",,"2024-09-29T20:52:03-04:00","971939805","5","971939805","Book your stay and plan day trips to Sigiriya climb, Pidhurangala climb, Safari and we say about 120 Elephants, Sri Lanka village experience","room_tip",,"2024-09-22T20:47:05-04:00","970940434","5","970940434","Full body massage with herbal steam bath highly recommended ","room_tip",,"Hotel","REGULAR_AWARD","HOTEL","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12901411-d4878877-Reviews-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html","https://www.themacollection.com/aliya-resort/",

We were born here and most of our childhood memories are connected with jungle experiences. The love and knowledge we gained from childhood came into live since 2003, when we started our first campsite. We could gain the reputation as one of the best safari camping providers of South Asia from the courage of ours and the continuous satisfaction thus came from our guests. Now we have 6 luxury tents and they are identified as the best campsites of Yala and the best location of Yala. We are the only campsite provider who registered with Independent Safari Association of Yala and we are the only provider in such an unique wild life habitat. Yes it is absolutely a wildlife kingdom where we are located in…. We invite you to share our experiences with wild life and nature while enjoying the best safari camping features of Sri Lanka. Yala National Park is located in the south eastern region of Sri Lanka and extends over two provinces of Hambantota district of southern province and Monaragala district in Uva province. There are 2 popular entrances to the park which are t Palatupana and Katagamuwa. Since Palatupana is always busy , we use Katagamuwa entrance. Yala National Park that consists of five blocks is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka. Though Yala spreads over an area of 1260 square kilometers, only one fifth of the area is open to the visitors. Four-fifths of the park is a strictly designated Natural Reserve. Adjoining the eastern border of the park is Kumana. The gateway to Yala National Park is Tissamaharama. The well-designed visitor center provides the information to the tourists and assigns a tracker to all incoming vehicles. Dawn and dusk bring about the best timing for Safari tours in the Yala National Park. Being located in one of the arid regions of Sri Lanka, the Climate of Ruhuna National Park is usually hot and dry. The mean annual temperature is 27 Celsius, although in the dry season the temperature could go as high as 37 Celsius. The rocky outcrops scattered over the park provides vantage points to enjoy the sprawling areas with Sri Lanka’s dry zone landscape: low scrub and woods. Still more, the southern border of the park being the south-eastern coast, the brackish lagoons and dunes enhances the distinctive charm of the Yala National Park.","info@srilankayalasafari.com","0.0",,"5817895","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/74/c0/f4/yala-safari-camping.jpg","Sri Lanka","false","6.378556",,"","Yala National Park","81.38269","Yala Safari Camping","509","6","+94 77 317 5482","1430","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/74/c0/f4/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/5d/50/6b/middle-of-jungle-sunrise.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/4d/cb/2e/luxury-camping-tent-cottage.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/4d/ca/16/wildlife-and-safari-game.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/c0/e3/romantic-dinner-under.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/74/c1/10/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/cd/e8/leopard-at-yala-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/c7/33/leopard-at-yala-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/c3/a5/sundeck.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/90/f5/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/69/5a/sundeck-evening-view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/69/16/sundeck-evening-view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/c7/69/a9/sundeck-evening-view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/47/de/ea/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/47/de/e8/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/2a/3c/51/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/2a/3c/43/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/2a/3c/3e/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/2a/3c/2f/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/9b/3d/ac/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7f/fc/a1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/4d/bb/20/yala-safari-camping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/e7/0b/ae/beyond-expectations.jpg",,,,,,,,,"$$$","$209 - $281","21","3","#3 of 21 campgrounds in Yala National Park","5","1","3","6","32","467","4.796726226806641","2024-09-17T00:45:42-04:00","970105025","5","970105025","Reach hotel before 1pm to join the afternoon safari tour","room_tip",,"2024-07-12T21:13:26-04:00","959253839","5","959253839","Note that there is a long walk down some 62 steps to get to the camp ground from reception area.
