The rooms were clean, the decor was amazing, the showers were exceptionally good and powerful and the pool was a dream.  Being able to get on the beach at the bottom of the garden was amazing and the outside furniture to rest was very comfortable.  The chef produced some delicious, highly presented food, there was no need to go elsewhere.  We all loved our 2 night stay and everything was made perfect by Sunil and his staff.

Special word of appreciation to Mr Sunil and his helpful, attentive staff. They make the best Sri Lankan milk tea! ☺️ All the food we ordered was fabulous, they accommodated all our requests (extra cups of tea during the day!) and went above and beyond to be helpful and attentive.

We really appreciated the peace, calm and quiet as well as the safety offered for a group of female travellers!

The villa is a beautiful construction in itself and it has been very tastefully furnished by the owners.  The rooms are spacious and we felt at home immediately. It wasn’t just the environment that made us feel at home. We very much appreciated the warm welcome and attention to detail provided by Sunil, the manager. Sunil took time to get to know us and our personal preferences which meant that he gave a high level of personal service that you don’t get in other properties. The rest of the team also made sure that everything was perfect for our stay;  the delicious food served, the spotless garden area and the cleanliness of the whole villa. Last but not least, the pool and the view over the beach just took our breath away and we spent many an hour gazing at the trees, beach and waves. Villa Saffron will recharge anyone’s batteries.

Visiting at the start of the off-season, we were delighted to find that we practically had the entire villa to ourselves, providing an intimate and exclusive experience.

The villa's staff were outstanding; their attention to detail and genuine care ensured our stay was comfortable and memorable. The facilities at the villa were first-class—everything was clean and well-maintained, from the spacious interiors of the rooms, huge bathrooms, to the expansive balcony offering plenty of privacy. The ambiance was perfect for relaxation and unwinding.

One of the highlights was the food prepared on-site; it was simply first-class, rivaling top restaurants in flavor and presentation. Having the ability to walk straight out to the ocean and enjoy a clean, serene beach was the cherry on top of our relaxing stay.

While the villa isn't close to major shopping areas, it didn't detract from our experience as the tranquility and beauty of the location were exactly what we needed after days of travel and sightseeing.

From the ambience, to the beautiful location, this villa ticks all the boxes. I want to give a special thank you to Sunil, Kasun and the rest of the staff at the villa who were incredibly hospitable and catered to all our needs. A second special thank you to the in-house chef who dished up some mouth watering food which was honestly better than most restaurants around the area. 

We would definitely go back to this beautiful place and I can easily recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation on the coast!","A top tier villa in Sri Lanka","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r947432343-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","452388042","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906shenalis","Shenali S","F7F618400E96EFB22345A39DE519C309",,,,,"906shenalis"

A warm friendly Sri Lankan welcome. The same faces, warm, helpful, discreet and kind.
Just 5 rooms you feel you are staying in your own private villas. Lovely pool, delightful room. Direct access onto the most wonderful beach.
Situated on the edge of town far enough away to feel peaceful but a walk away if you want more activity.
The villas has been so beautifully and sympathetically restored and furnishings reflect that as does the artwork.

Saffron is such a gorgeous property. Architecturally designed with beautiful touches.  It is definitely a private home not a hotel kind of place, which is exactly what we wanted. We had the largest room there (Saffron) up on the first floor with a huge external balcony too, overlooking the pool/ocean. All the other rooms looked lovely too, all with there own special features. We ate well, sitting on the terrace enjoying the delicious food and relative calm. The grounds were very well looked after and it was a lovely place to sit and chill by the pool. The surf was a short walk up the beach, the main reason for staying in that area, and did not disappoint. The non-surfer was equally happy walking on the beach and just enjoying Villa Saffron! Sunil and his team were incredible…..could not fault their attention to detail and were always available, yet very discreet, should anything be needed.  What a great team…..thank you so much.","Highly recommend Villa Saffron","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r934654211-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","452390771","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2882FWhelenl","Helen L","29B38073E3CF6C7C0EB5B2EB0DAF7426",,,,,"S2882FWhelenl"

Tucked away from the bustling road, this quiet retreat provided the perfect escape. The highlight was undoubtedly the outstanding staff, with Manager Surin leading the way in ensuring a memorable experience.

The location strikes a perfect balance—serene and peaceful, yet just a swift 5-minute journey to the vibrant restaurant and shopping hub. The villa’s limited size, with only 5 rooms, lends an intimate atmosphere that adds to the charm.

A piece of advice: book the rooms on 1st floor to enjoy added privacy. The ground floor lacks the seclusion found in the upper levels. 

Overall, Villa Saffron is a hidden gem, offering tranquility and top-notch service.","Nice , Private , quiet .","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r934338469-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","724476446","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","238","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","522","882","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","1024","1103","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/2e/a2/1e/caption.jpg","1280",,,,"1","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad64218374000","Mario","AE60862D974F7F2302398C12A4FC7EE4",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","Nomad64218374000"

So if you are looking for character with a lovely chilled garden pool area look no further! All the staff are so friendly and the food is beyond delicious- as well as having a lovely breakfast here each morning, we enjoyed a fresh tuna salad and their amazing Sri Lankan curry. We enjoyed our stay here!

What stood out most was the size of the rooms, the cleanliness of the premises (thanks to Akalanka, Deep and Sugath), and the devotion of the employees, especially Ravidu and Surangi! Everyone was welcoming and extremely helpful. They didn’t hesitate to give good recommendations of what to do or where to go, like the nice receptionist and the kind manager.

The small-scale hotel is located in the lee of the main road. The friendly staff likes to make guests feel at home whenever possible. Fresh fruit juice on arrival as a welcome drink. 
In the room, with sea view, everything is there. Space for the suitcase, tea and coffee making facilities, minibar, safe etc. The towels decorated in a special way. 
The chef, Supun, comes to ask about your wishes. As a vegetarian, I can really appreciate that. A man with a lot of experience! The pool is lovingly maintained daily by Sugath. He takes care of the garden and is ready with the pool towels as soon as you want to lie down.
Varna, the manager is very friendly and willing to have a chat and think along with you.","Persoonlijk en niet massaal","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r964508121-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","452388139","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irisvE2088KR","Iris v","F20E269DECF2A38CEB1A79A6A46BA9FF",,,,,"irisvE2088KR"

The stay was very special right from the start. Within a very short time we felt like we are staying with friends. 
All the staff, from the ""pool boy"" Sugath, to the waiter Ravindu and his colleagues, to the manager Warna... everyone was just fantastic! 
The meals which were prepared in the kitchen were excellent! 

The entire complex and the rooms are very well maintained. The location on the quiet stretch of beach is also worth mentioning.

It was very difficult for us to say goodbye.

We had a beautiful room with sea view, the pool was fantastic, the food was the best we've eaten in Sri Lanka, but what made it for us were the staff here were just outstanding. Each and every member of the team worked so hard to make their guests happy. They greeted us with smiles, were helpful and so very friendly. The manager Warna is wonderful, couldn't do enough and we loved our chats with him. Sugath's smiles around the pool, attentive at every moment to us and kind to our daughter, getting drinks, towels and balls for the pool (he even cleaned our tuk tuk rental for us!) Sampath was courteous at meal times, explaining the different dishes and Kalani made us welcome from the start as did all the staff here who helped with our bags and kept our room wonderfully clean, I wish I could name each individually as they all deserve a mention! 

We ate at the hotel as the chef took the time to talk with the guests and he put my mind at rest that he would serve Sri Lankan food that wasn't too spicy for us. The food was wonderful! It was a pleasure to stay and eat here. 
Overall, with only 6 rooms the hotel feels peaceful, it's quiet around the pool and beach, but it's not too far from the main town for the restaurants and shops. Pool is perfect with shady spots during the heat of the day, plenty of sun loungers and right on the beautiful beach. Rooms were bright and spacious with great air con comfy beds and a huge bathroom and balcony. We couldn't have wanted for more. 

Thanks to all of you for making the last 3 nights of our holiday very memorable! 

I hope we can return to Hikkaduwa and Roman Beach Hotel.","The BEST hotel!","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r946135839-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg","1541400","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","68","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg","80","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/00/17/85/18/hazey.jpg","241",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"76","148","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazey","hazey","7A11283AE3ED5DC59CE697482DCA0054",,"186364","Sheffield, United Kingdom","Sheffield","hazey"

Having been to Sri Lanka many times, this was the first time we had stayed at a boutique hotel.

The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to be on a quieter side of Hikkaduwa, slightly away from the crowds but only a short walk from the bars/ restaurants and shops. It feels very private. 

The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel with gorgeous furnishings, all creating a very cosy, relaxing vibe. The rooms are spacious and bright with an amazing-sized balcony, all with an outstanding sea view. 

The beds are super comfortable and all the room amenities make it feel extra special. The hotel has a high level of cleanliness throughout and the housekeeping staff do an excellent job in the rooms. Attention to detail is superb in all areas. 

 The pool is very well maintained and provided lots of fun for my baby boy. The pool staff, especially Sugath do an excellent job. My baby is still asking for him. His kindness will not be forgotten. Every staff member went above and beyond to make our stay feel extra special. Warune the manager was very attentive, he would go out of his way every day to make sure my family was comfortable. Supan the chef is very talented at what he does. We ate the best food we have ever tasted in Sri Lanka. We recommend the Sri Lankan Curry as it’s absolutely delicious! The restaurant staff were all excellent and again my baby will miss Bhagya, Udshion and Akalanka. Kelanee on reception is very polite and caring. Christi is also a lovely man, we can’t thank him enough for his kindness. The hotel really does have a nice atmosphere and I believe the staff are to thank for this. 

If you are looking for a warm welcome and want to be made to feel like family, do not hesitate to book Roman Beach. You will not be disappointed.

I can only recommend this hotel and if I am in Hikkaduwa again, I will definitely stay there again.","A ten out of ten","2024-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r936604718-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","452389307","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennis_jjd","Dennis D","E53BF0157823199C0189E72BA083CD27",,"188045","Switzerland","Switzerland","dennis_jjd"

Blue sea, sky and palm trees. Ground floor is clean and modern. Service is generally very good.  Turtles are guaranteed. Tipping is mandatory really, it's hard to get a feel for tipping levels given how many rupees there are to other currencies.
Less good is the immediate poverty beyond the hotel, with security at the hotel a barrier to locals entering. Begging is rife, with tourists easy targets, from anything to buying seaweed to feed the turtles to offers of private taxi tours. The Hikkaduwa main drag is not attractive but there are interesting shops and restaurants within walking distance.
The rooms need an overhaul, the bathrooms in particular are date. Our air conditioning was temperamental, we had a fan, mobile air con unit (didn't work) and in room air con unit, which worked but was incredibly noisy.  The smoke alarm had a green flash to indicate it was working, but this illuminated the room at night. Generally it was hard to sleep.","Beautiful location, rooms in need of a bit of tlc","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r978515601-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","452389359","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8856FMjulianw","Julian W","935F54D76EFE07313385DA333F4AAF0E",,,,,"F8856FMjulianw"

We booked Hikkatranz as a base and also went travelling around Sri Lanka. 

Firstly, Sri Lanka is a beautiful place. 

First impressions of a few members of staff (a main lady) on the entrance of the restaurant were not great. She was not too welcoming, very dismissive and rude. 

However, as we settled into our trip we enjoyed ourselves. The food was tasty and never repetitive. There was everything from authentic Sri Lanka food, to Russian, English, Asian etc cuisine.  

The grounds are beautiful and well maintained and the rooms are large. Special mention to Dinash, he was our room cleaner. He went the extra mile daily and made us feel welcome during our stay with his daily conversations and smiley face. 

One thing that marred our experience a tiny bit were the big organised groups of men that would embark upon the hotel and fully take over the place, getting drunk, loud and lairy. 

Also, the turtles that swam to the shore line of the beach added to the magic of this holiday. 

All in all, good and I’d highly recommend this hotel.","Dinash was a superstar","2024-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r976485624-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","769409266","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","451","952","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/dc/40/f2/caption.jpg","954",,,,,,,"0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siannaf2024","Sianna Fraser - Smith","8AA7979628041CB3F2C378C9D4FC7A39",,"186370","Bath, United Kingdom","Bath","siannaf2024"

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the local vendors outside of the property. We understand that this can be a frustrating experience.

Rooms were very clean and all enjoying sea views. Perfect beachside location for seeing turtles although be prepared for locals pestering you to buy seaweed to feed the turtles. A firm but polite no thank you and keep walking does the trick. Dont get sucked into the line ""Where are you from"" as soon as you enter a convo you'll be hounded. We were told by one local it was his birthday and wanted us to buy him a beer (at 9.30am) he stood at the exit of the resort to the beach the whole day shouting and waving trying to get our attention, so be warned.  Anybody visiting must try the Crab Shack as the food and service is absolutely fantastic!! We went out of season so nothing much happening but theres so much to see, there's plenty to fill your day.

The hotel ambience was very nice. We were pleasantly surprised from the get go as we were given an upgraded room for no additional charge. The view from the balcony was spectacular and the beach was lovely too. The TV had a good selection of channels and the gym was very decent for fitness enthusiasts. The staff was very pleasant and friendly and the overall vibe was very upbeat and great. My little one was given a toy turtle much to her delight. The food was very good, especially the breakfast which we enjoyed a great deal. The lunch room also has a section that is very close to the sea. I thoroughly recommend having a meal or two there as you have the sound of the ocean and fresh sea breeze as you have your meal...very relaxing indeed.

They couldn't do enough for us, making us feel right at home. Our room, number one, was of a five-star standard—beautifully and tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean, and equipped with everything needed for a luxurious stay. The beds were extremely comfortable, ensuring a restful night.
Breakfast was a highlight, freshly prepared by the host and their team. We had the choice between Sri Lankan and international options, both generous in portion and delicious.
The pool was lovely, the lounge areas very comfortable, and the rooftop offered a serene sea view. The property is quiet and well-secured, and the staff were always ready to assist with rides, exercise, activities, and local dining recommendations in Hikkaduwa.
Highly recommend this property—it was the best place we stayed during our visit to Sri Lanka. We'll certainly be returning soon.

We booked both rooms of the villa and both were immaculately clean, so spacious and had everything we needed and more! From complimentary snacks to robes and toiletries. The breakfast was an amazing three course meal with a fruit platter, variety of Sri Lankan food and dessert. Chamara was so attentive to detail that he even switched out the fruits we didn’t eat on the first morning, to fruits that we liked for the breakfast on the second day. 
The place was very serene and we felt so safe as a group of girls.

A great combination of luxury, comfort, and excellent service which made our stay really memorable.","Beautiful hotel, great location!","2024-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d8669735-r964135316-The_Residence_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","452387929","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B491FQnaomis","Naomi S","BE68676ED08EB5107F1C0E35318E0527",,,,,"B491FQnaomis"

The facilities are excellent, with great surroundings and ambience. Since there’s only two rooms, there’s wonderful privacy, silence, solitude. The local breakfast is amazingly delicious and freshly cooked each morning. And it’s served in the rooftop overseeing the area and beach. The walk to the nice stretch of beach is a breeze. The host is great help in every way and very accommodating.

Every detail has been carefully considered to give guests the best and most comfortable stay. 

The rooms/apartments are huge and so tastefully decorated with  flowers and bright woven fabrics. Linens are luxurious and towels are big and thick. There are USB plugs, plenty of bottled water, great toiletries, a rechargeable torch, tea, coffee, biscuits. 

The pool is lovely and the lounges comfortable,

Security is excellent and the place is quiet. 

Breakfast is always generous with the best fresh fruit, fresh juice, eggs and toast - and always a lovely sweet surprise to follow. Coconut pancakes are a favorite! 

Charmara, the host really engages with his guests to make sure they have everything they need and that they are happy. He can offer help with rides, excursions and advice about restaurants and facilities at Hikkaduwa ( like the best dive schools etc). 

This was my second visit and I will certainly be coming back soon.

I would like to note the excellent combination of price and quality of this property! The villa has only two identical rooms on the 1st and 2nd floors, the room is very large, it can comfortably accommodate three people (there is 1 double and 1 single bed), the room is impeccably clean, snow-white bed sheets, towels, towels for the pool are provided separately. The room has a good, fresh renovation, everything is quite modern, there are bathrobes, all the accessories for a comfortable stay (shower gel, shampoo, some other little things). Excellent breakfasts, every day we were served fruit (watermelon, bananas, mango, papaya), smoothies, coffee with milk, scrambled eggs with sausages, toast, and they were constantly supplemented with something new. It’s impossible to eat everything)) The villa’s grounds are very well maintained, a nice swimming pool, a very attentive owner who was ready to resolve any issue as quickly as possible. It felt like we were visiting good friends. Location: The villa is a five-minute walk from the main road, which runs parallel to the coast. There are different cafes nearby, we usually chose Google Maps based on reviews and went to different places. For those who are planning an independent trip around the island, the location is also very convenient, as the bus station and railway station are within walking distance. In general, I recommend this villa for those who are tired of the huge number of people in hotels and want to relax purely with their family or company, while receiving good service and comfortable accommodation.","wonderful villa for a relaxing holiday","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d8669735-r949718962-The_Residence_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","452392029","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture14314521137","Venture14314521137","5DFAD40D999BDCA30FF265104D69F8BC",,,,,"Venture14314521137"

The breakfast was delicious and served in two options: continental and Sri Lankan, with a lovely view from the rooftop. Additionally, the property had a pool and lounge chairs, where you could relax after a long day.Despite the short duration of our stay, the presence of flowers everywhere added a charming atmosphere.

We stayed in the villa on the ground floor and it was extremely comfortable. It's very spacious and has a large comfortable bed and an additional single bed in the room. It had all the amenities that you would expect for a luxury room; air conditioning, plenty of international power sockets, mini bar, complimentary water, TV, Tea and Coffee, WiFİ and optional Breakfast. 

The location is excellent, just a short 5 min stroll to the main street and a further 5 min to the beach and the bay where you can see turtles, and baby turtles being released for the first time since hatching in the evening. 

Chamara, our host was friendly and very helpful. He arranged transfers to the hotel and made lots of great recommendations for places to eat in the area. He was always very responsive via WhatsApp if we had any questions prior to or during the stay there.","Perfect retreat in Hikkaduwah ","2024-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d8669735-r943624829-The_Residence_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","165715888","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","50","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/e0/9f/b0/psxant886.jpg","450",,,,,,,,,,"2","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarethLivingstone","Gareth","2FC2B1EC42CC056DEF21B08F8F8274CB",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","GarethLivingstone"

Wow what a place! There are only 2 rooms at The Residence, both are decorated really well. The bathroom has a separate toilet one side and shower the other. The rainfall shower is really good! The room also has a large double bed, air conditioning, TV with satellite channels, well stocked fridge  and hairdryer. We were on the upper floor and had a great view of the pool....

We had breakfast every morning at 9am and we ate at the table outside our room. The breakfasts are also really good!

The pool and 4 sunbeds just make it extra special as privacy is guaranteed along with the personal service!

Finally, the location. The Residence is located around 200mts from the main strip and only 300mts or so from the bus station and train station. Ideal if you are travelling around!

We stayed in the spacious Vayu Pool Villa, which was well-maintained and provided a tranquil retreat with a pristine private pool. The villa’s layout offered comfort, luxury, and privacy—ideal for a relaxing holiday.

Breakfasts at the resort began with a fresh fruit platter featuring a delightful selection of local fruits, a wonderful start to each day. The Sri Lankan breakfast with flavorful beef and fish curries was a standout, showcasing authentic local cuisine. For lunch, our parents enjoyed a delicious serving of fish and chips, while the southern-style fish in banana wrap was splendidly prepared and packed with flavor.

Dinner arrangements were memorable, with the first night set up on the beach for our family of six, including our parents. The beachside ambiance paired with a delicious meal made it an evening to remember. On the second night, our dinner in the garden, surrounded by candlelight under a starry sky, was truly magical. The fish was perfectly prepared, and our eight-year-old son loved the fish and chips so much he wanted it again!

To end the meals on a sweet note, we indulged in the chocolate chip sundae for dessert, which was absolutely fabulous and worth every bite.

The serene beachfront, attentive hospitality, and Aditya’s overall ambiance make it an idyllic holiday getaway. From the front desk to the restaurant team, the staff’s genuine warmth and dedication made us feel truly at home. We highly recommend Aditya Resort Rathgama for anyone seeking a beautiful, peaceful retreat on Sri Lanka’s coast.","A Perfect Getaway at Aditya Resort Rathgama - August 2024","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r977670005-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","452387457","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","1200","1","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daminda2017","Daminda de Silva","D7D686B601268A240FD2D6AC4DD64841",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","daminda2017"

I had been trying to decide between the pool suite and Surya, but the privacy and space in Surya made it the best choice for us. We had our own plunge pool on the rooftop with views of the ocean, sun chairs, a giant shower, living room space, covered patio, and even an outdoor toilet on the rooftop (to avoid going down the stairs at night) in addition to one in the traditional bathroom. Not only did the room feel super luxurious, but the food was delicious, and we enjoyed the spa services as well. We found luxury in the details of the hotel- such as welcome snacks in the room, a congratulations cake and card, no fees for room service,  no closures of the restaurant between meal times, the beautiful fresh flowers everywhere, and the constant care of the staff.

We were warmly greeted with beautiful aralia garlands and a refreshing passion fruit juice as our welcome drink, setting the tone for what would be an incredible experience.

The staff at Adithya Boutique Villa went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. They were not only attentive but always smiling, creating such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Their hospitality made us feel truly at home.

The villa itself is stunning, with its charming décor and serene ambiance making it the perfect getaway. We stayed for just one night, but it was an experience we’ll remember for a long time. Thank you, Adithya Boutique Villa, for an unforgettable stay. We can’t wait to return!

celebrated  my 60th B’day with all of my besties at Aditya this weekend. 

From the time I chose Aditya and made a reservation I was given the maximum support by the General manager Mr. Shamindra Fernando and the resident manager Mr. Susil. Every aspect of the arrangement were discussed and arranged to my absolute satisfaction. 

On arrival we were garlanded with fragrant frangipane flowers and served delicious fresh passion juice….there followed a wonderful tea service in the garden… we then chillaxed near the bar and the pool and thereafter dressed up for evening cocktails with delicious canapés and a super al fresco 4 course dinner under the stars. 

The staff, the service, the ambience, the decor,  the quality of the meals were amazing. 

On returning to my suite my room had been decorated to resemble a fairyland of candles with a wonderful banner wishing me a fabulous birthday. I have never been this spoilt and was truly touched by the care taken to make this day so special for me. 

Thank you Aditya for  making my dream of an amazing birthday come to life. 

Me and my guests were totally blown away❤️❤️❤️","Perfect place for a milestone birthday","2024-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r968856264-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","452390771","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDESColombo","Sharmela de Silva","9028A65FF7F639643D65E7992CB92145",,,,,"SDESColombo"

The staff is unmatchable, I haven't received such a friendly and efficient service anywhere else, they served us like we were a part of their family. The food was delicious, and every dish we had was the best we have ever had. And the cleanliness in the resort was on point. The GM, Mr Susil and the team were very friendly and made us feel like home. Everyone had smiles that we would never forget!

The resort is a wonderful combination of view, charm, elegance, finesse, merged with the ever so courteous staff and delicious food. We could never have bargained for anything more and left the resort at the end of our stay with great regret. The ever so willing to help nature of the staff was very comforting and we were made to feel nothing was ever missing. Susil, the Reservation Manager mad us feel so wanted and ensured our comforts. I would love to be here again.

We were met by Shamindra and his team who went above and beyond to make our stay truly unforgettable. What's remarkable is that everyone working at Aditya feels like a family member, they all give their all in everything they do and they do so with a smile. 

The rooms are exceptionally large and the bathrooms are incredible. The bathroom is an open concept with a big jacuzzi. 

The food was amazing as well and they have so many options whether it's authentic Sri Lankan food or Western food. The choice is yours and no one will say no to you if you want to mix and match. 

We loved the beach and even though we couldn't swim in the ocean it felt like a private stretch of beautiful sandy beach. 

Thank you for making our stay so special and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly unique experience.","A resort like no other","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r956320183-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","452388139","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimm317","Karim M","8B0F19F1AAB13704B66C726E2B54DB6D",,,,,"karimm317"

We went out of season, so there was renovation going on, but it did not have a negative impact","Amazing trip!","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r971378270-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","452389554","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1911HQ_","Anastasiia K","8272C02A9414A7FA91D646BE9D495367",,,,,"M1911HQ_"

We were met at reception by a stunning young lady who made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in.
The food is amazing, I had the best works beef burger, the beer is icy cold (we are Aussies and love cold beer) and the staff couldn't have done any more for us.
The rooms are great, the whole Hotel is very well presented. We even had our towels made in to little love hearts.
I am sitting on the pool deck enjoying the sun while watching the waves crash on the shore
I would highly recommend this hotel.

The first thing that pleased me was the location of the hotel on the first line by the sea.  The room had a beautiful view of the endless ocean, which created a unique atmosphere of relaxation and tranquility.

 The room I stayed in was spacious, comfortable and clean.  All necessary amenities were available, making the stay as comfortable as possible.  The service at the hotel was top notch - the staff were friendly, attentive and responsible.

 The hotel pool also had an excellent location - overlooking the sea.  I spent a lot of time on the sun lounger, enjoying the sun and the coolness of the pool at the same time.

 The cuisine at the hotel deserves special mention - breakfasts and dinners were varied and delicious.  I was able to try various Sri Lankan and international cuisines.

 I highly recommend Coral Rock by Bansei in Sri Lanka if you are looking for the perfect place to relax by the sea with comfort and excellent service.","Coral Rock by Bansei hotel","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r956893851-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","452389009","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479kirillg","Kirill G","33C8693AF95D44F4819C8A11419F3FCF",,,,,"479kirillg"

It was also very convenient to have a beach and all beach facilities right in the hotels terrace. 
There were drawbacks too like outdated furniture in the room (for instance hairdryer was barely heating) and construction works in the neighboring building 

As for the furniture - it didn’t bother us at all, cause overall experience was nice - the room was clean and smelled good. 
As for the construction works - i understand that this was not the responsibility of the hotel stuff and they cannot do anything with it. Sometimes the noise was heard, sometimes it didn’t - all depends on the day of the week. All in all, it wasn’t too loud so it was possible to relax.

First of all, we thank you for this wonderful review and recommendation. We’re delighted to hear that you had a comfortable stay at Riff Hikkaduwa and enjoyed the beautiful ocean views. It's great to know that you found the hotel’s atmosphere chic and that our team made you feel welcomed and well looked after throughout your stay.

Our room was clean and really comfortable with a fantastic view out to the beach and Indian Ocean.  The hotel has a real chic feel about it - and the staff without exception are incredibly friendly and welcoming.  We have to give a huge shout out to the hotel driver who picked us up and dropped us off at Colombo Airport - as well as taking us out for a day to Yala National Park where we had the good fortune to not only see elephants and mugger crocodiles but also a leopard.

Breakfast was excellent and both restaurants have good food and varied menus.  This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the hotel was well placed to not only relax but to also see some of the country, the Old Fort in Galle being another great visit.

And loved the ""towel elephant"" left on our bed on our last night !!","Perfect Ocean Views and Comfortable Rooms","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r973652926-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","452388586","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","52","87","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/325duncans","325duncans","66306F055663E8617AA03132D496B334",,"503832","Hartley Wintney, United Kingdom","Hartley Wintney","325duncans"

We’re especially pleased that our cuisine, particularly the biriyani, was a highlight of your stay. We’re also grateful for your kind mention of our staff’s efforts in making your dining experience special, particularly in catering to your mother’s vegetarian needs.

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm and peaceful. One of the best parts of our stay was the hotel's beachfront location, providing us with stunning views and easy access to the beach.

The food was absolutely delicious. In fact, our return trip was largely motivated by the warm hospitality and fantastic cuisine. Everyone in our group enjoyed the meals, especially the biriyani, which was incredibly flavorful and generously filled with chicken pieces and cashews. We were even able to thank the chef personally for making the best biriyani we've ever had.

Special mention goes to the waitress, Benisha. She remembered us from our previous visit and was extremely helpful, always suggesting the best dishes for us to try and doing so with a big smile. She made our dining experience even more enjoyable. Additionally, since my mother is a vegetarian, Benisha provided her with a full board menu featuring a variety of vegetarian dishes, which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

Thank you so much, Riff Hikkaduwa, for making our stay memorable. We truly enjoyed every moment and look forward to visiting again.","A Perfect Retreat at Riff Hikkaduwa: Exceptional Hospitality and Delicious Cuisine","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r960251188-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","677618926","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","1024","1204","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/63/a4/ee/chanuki-s.jpg","1204","1","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chanukis","Chanuki","C2100AB76B1F903287067A13F9E2218D",,,,,"chanukis"

What is most impressive is their restaurants - didn’t expect we could have such decent quality of Japanese food at their rooftop Japanese restaurants. The breakfast sets served at their G/F restaurant were amazingly delicious and fruitful.
Our stay wouldn’t be that wonderful without all the very warm and helpful staff - they also gave us a very decent tea gift when we were departing.

The location is beautiful - absolute beach front with the sounds of waves 24/7. You can eat right beside the beach for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The rooms are colonial style with loads of character which we love. Very clean and tidy. Comfy beds too. 
Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are so friendly and accomodating. The food is delicious and the breakfast selection perfect. Make sure you order their Sri Lankan style breakfast the night before if you want that as an option. We ended up eating here most evenings too because it was so good. 
The pool is a good size and always clean, we enjoyed cooling off a few times in it after a hot day browsing the Hikkaduwa area. 
They even have a super friendly onsite dog and although there are a few stray dogs around (typical for this part of Sri Lanka) even they are super friendly and delightful company! We wish we could have brought one in particular home with us, he was such a gentle natured boy. 
Price is very reasonable we think, you wont regret staying here. 
Just a note that the beach isn't safe for swimming, but just being right on the beach is so beautiful you wont miss the ocean dip - just use the pool instead or go for a swim at nearby Turtle Bay.","A little gem in Hikkaduwa - and beach front perfection!","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r972590974-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","452390504","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","1","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnasO4257CU","Donna S","56E40569B1B0290573950596AE2EC8BF",,,,,"donnasO4257CU"

I enjoy Suite Lanka so much that I have now stayed here 3 times over the last 10 years……and I plan to return many more times. 

The fact that it is a small boutique hotel means that it is always quiet even when fully booked. The staff are so kind, attentive and friendly making the effort to get to know you personally. 

The facilities are just what you need to relax and soak up the amazing beach scenery. 

The restaurant Olins is incredible with fresh and tasty options made in a clean and professional environment. I would highly recommend the Sri Lankan breakfast and the Sri Lankan curries as my personal favourites, although there are multiple other tasty options. The food was so good that I would return to the hotel for meals regularly and only ate out a handful of times. 

The beach view is incredible from all the rooms.","A gem of a hotel with everything you could ask for to enjoy a relaxed stay","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r972208071-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","452391352","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donovanc824","Donovan C","4E265C656F1F8272C1531039E569C40C",,,,,"donovanc824"

Just finished a whistle stop tour of Sri Lanka.  9 hotels in 14 days ranging from small boutiques to large complexes and this was arguably my favorite of the lot!

We stayed in the Pool room which as the name suggests had access to both the pool and the beach. Plenty of room for 2 teens and 2 adults and very tastefully furnished.

A wonderful Sri Lankan breakfast (easily the best breakfast of my trip). Nice bar area and pool also which the kids enjoyed.

However,  its the staff that really make this venue. Friendly, cheerful, helpful. They are everything the hospitality trade should be.

This is a little gem of a hotel!","One night stay at Suite Lanka","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r967345911-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","452388198","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markrE7657BE","Mark R","52BEC541EADED24059F5C41AB812DD6F",,,,,"markrE7657BE"

Being a small hotel there was only our group and another two couples for dinner so there was a bit of rearranging for the dinner table for our group.  The meal we had was the best meal we had in our time in Sri Lanka.  We called out the Chefs and gave them the biggest praising clap and hooray for their efforts.   The rooms were clean and large with a view of the beach which at the time had crashing waves and lots of rain.  It was great to fall asleep to.  The bed was really comfortable.

Nothing is too much trouble for them, they are both friendly, helpful and hard working, always on hand to help with any little thing, even if it is just local travel advice. The deputy manager Kumarasiri was especially friendly and made sure our every need was met.
The room was huge an easily accomodated the four of us, we had the pool suite which opened on both sides, to the pool and also the beachfront garden, where you can dine, use the sunbeds or just relax on a sofa and read, that's if you don't want to sit on your large balcony.
The beds were very comfortable and the 4-poster in the main room was huge. everything was provided in the bathroom, loads of towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel.
The restaurant and dining were fabulous, breakfast has a range of options from traditional Sri Lankan breakfast with sambal and rice to continential or cooked, loads of fresh fruit and juice, and of course tea, it wouldn't be Sri Lanka without Ceylon tea. Evening meals were fabulous, we ate there most nights, very reasonable pricing for such tasty and feshly cooked food, i particularly enjoyed the black pork curry and my kids loved the fried noodles and fried rice.
Our kids loved the pool area, it's secluded and sheltered, right next to the rooms and the pool bar.
The hotel itself is secured at night and has a permanent security guard once the staff go home, the guard is a lovely fellow, constantly patrolling and keeping an eye out which is very reassurring. 
One day we had to leave to go to the temple at a very early hour of 5am, so the hotel prepared us packed breakfasts (which they didn't have to do) and the security guard made sure we had them ready for when we left.
I cannot reccomend this place more highly, out of the 5 places we stayed in Sri Lanka, from east to west coast, this was the highlight and the best accomodation experience, it way exceeeded my expectations, especially given the very cheap price, i would not have expected somewhere so good at such a low price per night for 4 people.","An amazing colonial-style boutique hotel with fabulous staff and facilities","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r965954499-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","452389795","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","8","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LennyH123456789","LennyH123456789","5F3029DBB28CA2516193B254EBBD6992",,"190801","Chippenham, United Kingdom","Chippenham","LennyH123456789"

The hotel is immaculate which is a credit to all the staff who work to ensure our stay was perfect not just from cleaning the room daily but those cheerful staff who keep the grounds so clean everyday.

The breakfast options are perfect, I would highly recommend the homemade muesli, it was delicious.  We opted to try the evening meals, this was absolutely superb, the quality and taste of the food was incredible, and was beautifully presented that we decided to eat at the restaurant every evening throughout our stay.

A special shout out to Kumarisir (I think that’s how you spell it) he was so welcoming on our arrival, ensured everything was perfect,  and always remembered what we had to drink.

We would definitely return to Suite Lanka and hopefully have the opportunity to stay in the Penthouse Suite.","Wonderful Hotel and amazing food","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r965785026-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","452391352","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClareF25","Clare F","7483D17EE6AF4287BBB6068D9F49A4D9",,"186402","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Birmingham","ClareF25"

What a wonderful time we had at this superb little hotel! From the moment we landed to the moment we left, we were made to feel so welcome and comfortable! It was almost as we were staying in a house with family members!!
When we arrived we were given a deliciously cold fruit drink and a wet cloth to refresh from Siri and his excellent team! Our room was beautiful, clean and huge with spectacular sea views!
Excellent shower and plenty of hot water!
The restaurant, sunloungers and the sea were just down the stairs, approx 20m away from us - it was just like paradise!
Breakfast was excellent - and in particular the banana and chocolate sauce pancakes - delicious!! Food was excellent - rice and curry, devilled chicken and the kebab - we hardly got through the vast menu during our 4 day stay! Our 5:30 cocktails made by Siri - a different one every day, was a lovely aperitif before dinner!
Excellent clean pool too!!
I would like to thank Siri in particular who looked after us so well! His English is excellent and he is so kind, intelligent and friendly- as were all the staff!
Thank you Suite Lanka - we will never forget you!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","Superb, fabulous, wonderful!","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r964382181-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","19820700","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","50","74","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","74","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/9c/avatar067.jpg","205",,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","22","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clustog","Caren M","C067147CDC02E6606207395A1A9EBA3F",,,,,"Clustog"

Despite being off-season, with many cafes and restaurants closed, the location was perfect. The beautiful beach was ideal for walks, and the area was pleasantly quiet.

We stayed on the top floor with a direct sea view. The room was massive, very comfortable beds, with writing table and sofa and it was like having our own apartment, complete with a big bathroom with a tub and a spacious common area. The Sri Lankan breakfast was fantastic, especially the dara poranu paang, a rare treat on the island. The club sandwich we had was delicious too.

The staff were extremely friendly and always ready to take pictures for us. We were allowed to check in early with no extra charge, which was great. The pool area was lovely and very photogenic. Our only regret was staying just one night; we wished we could have stayed at least two.","Amazing Stay at Suite Lanka","2024-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r963597348-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","682125291","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","1024","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/a8/67/eb/dinalilokugamage.jpg","1024","5","60","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinaliLokugamage","dinalilokugamage","812FC2ADA483F2CFAA0038A2963BBCDD",,"12693209","Dehiwala, Sri Lanka","Dehiwala","DinaliLokugamage"

hesitate, you won't regret booking here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We LOVED our time at Suit Lanka. From start to finish, we cannot fault a thing. The staff are fabulous and cannot do enough; the rooms are gorgeous -large, tastefully furnished and with excellent air conditioning; location is perfect at quieter end of beach; pool is lovely; bar is first rate and happy hour a bonus!
Hage to mention the fact that while check out is midday, we were able to use one of our rooms as a base to shower, charge phones etc until our airport pick up at 7pm. At no charge.
We would highly recommend staying at Suite Lanka.","Sweet Suite Lanka!","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r948226753-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","452391174","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","1","79","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate73HB","Kate73HB","0862D4BFDB2A9F6E5C3918B7A5DB6FA7",,"1556973","Havelock North, New Zealand","Havelock North","Kate73HB"

The hotel is very clean and the staff make you feel really welcome. I probably would rate this hotel a good 3 star not 4 as advertised. It is on the beach but on a coral reef so pool shoes advised. My only few bad comment would be the food is not hot and lots of chipped glasses and crockery which need replacing. I would also like to thank Nuan and Chinthaka in the restaurant for making us really welcome and looked after. A big shout out to Roger who runs karaoke on Wednesday and Thursday nights too he even managed to get my husband up to sing. Overall the staff make this hotel a good place to stay.","Lovely hotel","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r974343004-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","452389741","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","3","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannepP4259WE","Joanne P","31D227E39882EDA9735BA836588CEABB",,"661690","Retford, United Kingdom","Retford","joannepP4259WE"

We had two regular waiters on opposite shifts who looked after us tremendously and a big shout out to both of them (Nuan and Chinthaka) thankyou both so much.we found the Sri Lankan hotel customers quite rude at times and needed telling so which we did but prepare yourselves for the Russians….WOW a complete embarrassment to their country.I have never in my 56 years on this planet known such bad mannered greedy people in my whole life.Pushy and arrogant and i for one wouldn’t give them the time of day.I had to be restrained by my wife at somepoints before i did something regrettable.Big Shout out also to Roger the resident DJ who was great at his job and got everyone up singing on karaoke including me😁.Would i return to Sri Lanka yes i would and would i return to the Citrus definitely if it was Russian free.","Fabulous Stay","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r974341956-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","452391071","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1200","55","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBezza1968","Neil P","3A34B0513649E774893923D65CCA34DE",,"661690","Retford, United Kingdom","Retford","BigBezza1968"

the UK and from the two resort reps Ananda and Dexter. 
We booked  the Ella trip with the train ride which I can highly recommend, we loved the trip. Our guide Sanka was wonderful I recommended you request Sanka. 
Well done Mercury I’m impressed. 

We arrived after a 7 hour delay in Abu Dhabi and on arrival the reception staff were welcoming and very efficient 

The room was large with the best sea view ever.
The maid was the best. Everyday the room was spotless and he  made little bed decorations, towels  were changed everyday,  excellent job. 

The waiters and bar staff are good and the food was satisfactory. 

I loved the pool Aqua and found it was a very good workout. 

The two pool attenders gave a 7 star service in all the hotels I have ever stayed this was the best. The moment I arrived at the pool a sun bed was selected and the towel laid out for me. The two pools guys deserve a pay rise.

We used the Spa and can highly recommend it. Really good massage. 

Roger, did karaoke/ DJ  evenings we really enjoyed, everyone  got involved on these nights , they were great fun.
 Loved the live music in the evening, 

The beach is lovely golden sand and it’s a very short walk to an area where you can swim safely and it’s  here that you can feed the turtles, amazing 

Overall fantastic value for money 
Sri Lanka is beautiful the people are lovely and the country has lots to offer.","Ten out of ten","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r973225813-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","594163237","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","550","960","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/6a/36/25/x4440ewkathleena.jpg","960",,,,"2","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4440EWkathleena","Kathleen Alexander","CDBE20A5EBBA0158DDB9C8CA1E2C88C2",,,,,"X4440EWkathleena"

Staff were lovely, nice refreshing drink while filling forms in.  Asked for top floor which we got  and room was great and very clean.  The public areas were lovely and nothing too much trouble for the staff. We were bed and breakfast and there was always plenty to eat and variety we did have some lunches from the bar too.  We both had treatments from the spa and for hotel prices it was very good and the lady was lovely.  Hotel is well placed but preferred going right out of hotel to restaurants and bars. There is a supermarket opp where some people brought bottles of drink and left them and rubbish around the pool are and were demanding of the staff. (there is a war goin on in there country) Seeing the turtles in the shallow water was really nice but go early as later on lots of pushing and shoving on who’s getting the closest or the best picture. We took a tuktuk from outside the hotel turtle hatchery Urawatteseaturtle on galle road and we let go of some tiny little hatchlings we gave a donation to do this. We booked our main trip with our holiday company as we had heard you could be stuck with east euros who are loud abusive if we had booked outside, as they can cram you in so there was only 4 x of us and our drivers were good drivers and very knowledgable the trip was to Udawalawe national park. It was raining but that didn’t matter as we all thought it was fantastic a great day early start though but to go thru the towns and just see people were goin about there day we did have enough time on way back to go to Galle fort and have a quick walk round we even saw the man who dives into the water from the fort.  We are coming back to Scrilanka in November again and staying at the sister hotel Citrus Waskaduwa.","Best placed hotel in Hikkaduwa","2023-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r970827870-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","452391071","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1200","16","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slaterandj","slaterandj","37AD2F68075075D6AF8996533BF372B5",,"503828","Fareham, United Kingdom","Fareham","slaterandj"

We checked in for lunch, and there was already a big crowd. By that time, only steamed rice and Mexican rice were available as main dishes. The staff just wiped a table and gave it to us to sit at, without providing proper cutlery.

Dinner was the same. It seemed they had accepted too many bookings. There wasn’t enough space for in-house guests. We had to wait outside until some people finished their dinner and left. Just like lunch, there was no proper cutlery, and the tables were not cleaned properly. The same dessert items were available for both lunch and dinner. The meal plan was poor. Even at breakfast, they served the same fruits: watermelon, papaya, and browned bananas.

The check-in procedure was efficient, and we extend our gratitude to Pubudu, Damith, Sandun, Nadun, and the front office staff for their attentiveness to our needs.

Damith was exceptionally accommodating and played a significant role in making our stay memorable.

The children thoroughly delighted in their time at the beach and basking in the sun. 

The main aim of our holiday was to relax and enjoy the sun and the ocean.

Both the food and service were outstanding. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to Chef Roshan and his team (Nilanka, Thilina, Nandana, Nuwan, Chinthaka, Kaushalya, and Sahan).

We eagerly anticipate our next visit!

floor rooms are recommended as they have the best views of the beach and sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"My wife and I finished our 18 day holiday around Sri Lanka with 3 days at Suite Lanka- we couldn’t be happier. This little hotel is directly on the beach. We were lucky to have the room called Polonnaruwa on the first floor which has amazing views over the private garden and outdoor dining area to the smooth sandy beach and turquoise sea. The room was extremely spacious with a huge four-poster bed and colonial style furniture. In fact I would say that out of all the hotels we have stayed in, this was the most sumptuous. The room also had a huge private balcony with a massive and comfortable day bed. Ideal to enjoy watching the sun-setting with cold glass of Lion Lager or a gin and tonic from the bar. Breakfasts are amazing and we had the choice of a Sr Lankan breakfast , English Breakfast or Continental Breakfast. I can recommend both the English and Sri Lankan- freshly cooked and delicious. We also ate in the evening twice and thoroughly enjoyed the food which is always freshly prepared which means you might have to wait a little. 
You could tell that all the well trained staff enjoyed working at Suite Lanka- always smiling and happy to help with anything. The outside dining area looks onto the beach and there are a few comfortable sun-beds in the garden facing the sea and a few on the beach itself with parasols providing shade. We had a throughly relaxing stay at Suite Lanka and whilst it is at the quieter end of the beach- the noisier beach bars and restaurants are only  10 minute stroll on the beach. The hotel does have a small courtyard pool which we didn’t use as we spent our time on the sunbeds or paddling in the crashing waves. 
I highly recommend staying here. We couldn’t have wished for a better hotel to spend our last three days in Sri Lanka.","A Gem of a Hotel","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r939385668-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","452388731","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","75","212","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cambridge21","Cambridge21","F950B19C2C006A50F4C534D9C3D3F4F8",,"499501","St. Neots, United Kingdom","St. Neots","Cambridge21"

Our staff really enjoyed hosting you at Suite Lanka and you both really added to the positive and easy-going vibe of the place. As you know, we have all the sports channels in the rooms as well, but watching a match while the other person is asleep does create a few problems with the noise levels so we were pleased to open up the TV lounge! It is just a shame that the result did not go the way you wanted. We know that you stayed at some wonderful places on your tour so the staff are proud that you enjoyed Suite Lanka.

The location is great, with both Galle & Colombo in easy reach.  The position, with the beach just a few steps away from the rooms across the hotel’s private garden, means you can easily wander along the beach to choose where to eat.  But that’s not really necessary as the food at Suite Lanka is delicious - fantastic fresh seafood and local dishes as you’d expect, but also more than enough options to satisfy different tastes.  Our room was fab - large and airy, comfortably furnished, with the perfect view across the beach to the sea from the huge private balcony.  And the staff did a great job of making sure we had a great time - from tweaking menu options to suit our individual tastes, to opening the TV room at 1:45am so I could watch a football match. They strike exactly the right balance between being there to help whenever needed and not being intrusive.  After a busy couple of weeks exploring this lovely country, Suite Lanka was the perfect place to recharge, enjoying great food and service, and soaking up the very relaxed and luxurious feel.","Whether you’re recharging the batteries between stops or seeking an idyllic beach holiday, Suite Lanka is a gem.","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r937409428-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","727832066","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/61/d6/02/caption.jpg","1280","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philrF8750FY","Grumpy Phil","5B0F187C90EC93A83FE8EFB2A23CF3EB",,"209973","Ripon, United Kingdom","Ripon","philrF8750FY"

We were given a ground floor suite overlooking the ocean with a shady veranda to enjoy the view. Nice quiet hotel at the South end of the beach but only 15 minutes along the beach or a short tuktuk ride to town, even though there is really no need to go to town as there are plenty restaurants and a better beach in the vicinity.
We really liked the courtyard pool which was clean and cool. 
Breakfast was excellent, with a choice of Sri Lankan, English or continental. Everything was delicious and freshly prepared, so don't be in a rush!
We also enjoyed some Happy Hour cocktails sitting watching the sun go down over the ocean, heaven. 
Staff were friendly and everything is clean. Highly recommended.

stay. Wished we had stayed longer 

From our arrival we were welcomed by Chamara and his family. The hotel is situated a small walk from the main road, at the back of his private residence. 

The beach is within a short walk down the road. There are a few nice bars towards the railway line and a nice breakfast/lunch outlet on the corner. 

Beautiful apartments and work was continuing to improve them although we don’t think this was needed. 

Chamara was contactable throughout our stay and was available to answer any questions we had. 

It was my birthday whilst we stayed and everyone wished happy birthday, and given flowers and a small cake. Perfect little touches! 

On our last morning Chamara also took us to our next destination. I believe he also does tours of booked in advance. 

There are only 2 rooms so get booking quickly! We will definitely Recommend to others and book again if we return!

Charmera greets guests and explains the features of the room, the appliances, services like yoga and Ayurvedic massage and trips which can be arranged. 

The room itself is a 5-star designer suite with careful attention to even the smallest detail. There are comfortable chairs on the wide balcony and a breakfast table. The room itself is spacious with plenty of natural light and thoughtfully designed electric light throughout. USB ports were really appreciated. 

WC and shower are conveniently separated with a vanity and wide bench between these two rooms. 

The decor makes this room. Tasteful understated furnishings and interesting wall niches add to the practical charm of this well-designed space. 

The bed was really comfortable and security excellent. 

Breakfast is generous and exquisitely presented with plenty of fresh juice, fruits, and Sri Lankan options. 

I felt truly pampered here and enjoyed the interior and the pool area downstairs, which is also charming.

Charmara is attentive to guests’ needs and is very willing to go the extra mile to make each stay happy and memorable.","Outstanding five star boutique hotel at a reasonable price","2024-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d8669735-r936159565-The_Residence_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","50111234","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","50","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","136","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","150","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/fc/a3/02/fruittbatt.jpg","299",,,,,,,,,,,,,"163","213","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fruittbatt","Marie B","80917598EC06090A283FDACAE7433159",,"293917","Chiang Mai, Thailand","Chiang Mai","fruittbatt"

The mansion offered complete privacy, featuring a private pool, garden, rooftop terrace, and two spacious rooms with balconies. Our children especially loved the sunset evenings with BBQ on the rooftop, offering spectacular views.
The villa's location is incredibly convenient, just two hundred meters from the beach, minimarts, restaurants, and spas. The owner recommended a yoga session that we enjoyed in the garden and sometimes on the beach. Airport transfers to and from Colombo International Airport were provided by a nice van, and our host welcomed us warmly to Sri Lanka.
Daily breakfast, offering a list of options combining local traditional food and international breakfast, was served, accompanied by tasty freshly brewed local coffee. We are planning to return before the end of this year.

Our guests were treated to a luxurious and memorable experience. One of our guests required a special gluten free diet and Aditya staff looked after her food requirements with care.

Noticing this their restaurant staff got me a cold face towel without me asking for it. Special thanks to  Thiwanka and Indika from the restaurant staff for taking good care of us.

This was to be our final stop on a 10 day adventure travelling round the country, so we were looking forward to total relaxation.

We stayed in the beautiful Aditi Villa - a stunning villa with a huge outside area complete with private pool and shaded terrace with a gently swinging day bed. Our own private lawn where we watched the local mongoose family tootle across each day, lead directly onto the beach.

It was really bad timing that I had started to develop a dental infection, which stopped me in my tracks not long after we arrived! But to be honest, this is when you really see the true heart of a place and it's people. 
I was gutted to cancel our anniversary dinner, especially when we saw the efforts the team had gone to for us. (sparkly light, flowers...!) Not long after, there was a knock on the door and in came a concerned member of the restaurant team with a cup of ginger tea to make me feel better. They genuinely wanted to make sure I was OK.
I managed to get sorted with meds the next morning, and was able to enjoy the rest of my stay. 
The care, warmth and compassion I felt throughout our stay made me feel so relaxed and incredibly fortunate. The team really treat you like a returning friend. We felt so spoiled and genuinely cared for.

I would recommend Aditya to any client - couples or families  - anyone who would enjoy wonderful service and  food in relaxed boutique-style surroundings on a wonderfully rugged part of the Sri Lankan coastline. 

Huge thanks to all of you. Mr Shamindra, you have curated a superb team who thrive on making magical experiences for their guests with gorgeous personal touches.  You are doing amazing work.","The Dream Team....","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r952161360-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","397915535","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","550","750","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b7/b5/8f/sara-irving.jpg","750",,,,"10","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sara_irving","Sadie","063ABAA2E4C1625B463067BC3A51900A",,"186534","Glasgow, United Kingdom","Glasgow","Sara_irving"

Top notch hospitality at every step. Staff super attentive.  We were greeted with beautifully scented araliya garlands a refreshing cool towel and fresh juices. 

And every time we came down to the restaurant or to the bar the staff would be there immediately to pull out chairs, arrange the table, make sure every need was met. They really went out of their way to reflect the highest level of Sri Lankan top class hospitality.

The pool area was lovely. 

The food delicious. The menu offerings varied providing for a mix of Sri Lankan and western tastes

What is most stunning about this hotel is the furnishings and decor. Every time I turned my head there was something else to take my breath away. All the little details everywhere.

A huge room with very efficient AC, and WiFi was good throughout the hotel.

It served as a great base for our 3 week holiday. The staff and management were delightfully friendly and couldn’t do enough to make our stay very special. Additionally the food is of an extremely high standard with an extensive range of quality choice, the Chef and his staff continually produced delicious food and we had no cause for complaint about any aspect of this well run Restuarant.

Our only criticism of this location was that we are firmly of the opinion that the Aditya should definitely be an Adult only resort. The peace and quiet was completely uninterrupted until families arrived with young children and things changed significantly. There is only one pool with no facility to cater for children and this resulted in huge amounts of noise. So much so that unless the Aditya is clearly designated as Adult only, we would sadly not return in the future. A great shame as this was the only criticism we had for an otherwise ideal resort.","My wife and I were looking for a 5 star hotel in the south of Sri Lanka from which we could explore this lovely island.","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r941521721-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","452391289","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","1","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8642JMdavidj","David J","668B36EC2D1BE990F5569F78B256A598",,,,,"C8642JMdavidj"

were very fortunate to spend the last three days of our Sri Lanka holiday here. What an amazing boutique hotel, beautiful beach location, total tranquility.   

The huge suite was stunning with literally every detail considered.  Great welcome basket.  Spacious with super comfortable bed. Everywhere was spotless, a credit to the excellent housekeeping services.  

The pool and beach are lovely, and we were kept cool with water throughout the day.  

All of the staff provided an impeccable level of service, delivered with the utmost level of professionalism.  

We were half board and the dining experience was outstanding, beautifully presented, tasty and varied.  Loved the breakfast experience,  no set eating times above and beyond. 

Thank you 🙏 to everyone at the hotel for giving us such wonderful hospitality and memories.","Aditya ❤️","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r939724061-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","398278478","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/bd/3f/4e/piskie123.jpg","1280","74","254","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piskie123","Piskie123","D3F92106F2F47F0939DA0EC6872F027D",,,,,"Piskie123"

Specially I would like to highlight the entire pool staff and the entire crew at the beach bar. They had a fantastic collaboration and an eye on every finger. Outstanding. The buffet restaurant was world class - both for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At every meal we were greeted by a smiling Chamila, who could both scold (because I smoked) and smile at the same time.:). But our regular waiter, Nalaka, was just world-class.

Big shout out to Manoj from room  cleaning. His sense of humour and skill in towel origami is only outdone by his professional service.
The Head Chef and Resort Managers are amazing and have gone the extra mile to make us feel extremely welcome and even spoilt. They are supported by all the other Chefs, Cook's, Waiting staff, Kitchen staff, Indoor & Outdoor Bar staff, Security personnel, grounds keepers, and Admin staff. Hoppers are best in Sri Lanka cooked by a very lovely lady.
Rooms are well appointed with good cooling and bathroom facilities. Beds are big and made up every day as well as fresh towels and the room cleaned.
Pool area is beautiful with plenty of towels that can be used at the beach as well. 
The resort is located in a fantastic spot on the corner of the coast with a great swimming beach and another section where turtles come in to eat seaweed. 
A really great place for couples or families to relax at any stage of a Sri Lankan holiday. 
Definitely be back to stay next time and see all the Hikka Tranz Team.

The first time when me and my husband went to Riff, I was served raw chicken. They first said it’ll take 10 minutes to re-do the dish, and after the 10 minutes had passed, they suddenly said it’ll take another 15 minutes. We had only planned an hour for our lunch, so we had to leave and I had to be hungry for the rest of the day.

We tried our luck again, the second time we went to the Japanese rooftop restaurant. When we first went up, we were seated at the bar “while they fix a table for us”. We sat there for 10 minutes, without seeing any progress with our table, while there were at least 2 empty tables where we could’ve easily been seated to. Also there were groups of people coming in who got a table and service before us, even though we were there first.

When we finally got seated and served the food, it was very good. “Worth the wait,” we thought. In reality, we were hit again with a long waiting time for dessert which took them 50 minutes to bring out. The servers had little to none attention to us, we had to be the ones who made ourselves seen. 

Safe to say I’m incredibly dissapointed. I had super high hopes for this hotel as it looks absolutely stunning, but we gave it a chance twice, and it failed us both times.","May be a beautiful hotel but not a great dining experience","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r946432659-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","452390706","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannakaleininkas","Johanna","28AD5BC9E04AF96A15BD5313C027E813",,,,,"johannakaleininkas"

We spent the first four nights of our Sri Lanka trip at Riff. As a a family of 5 we had two first floor junior suites - and had a great time. The best hotel on our stay and one we would highly recommend to others.
Beautiful beach, instagrammable pool and roof top bar views. Fantastic breakfasts. Staff very friendly.

had a very nice stay at the Riff. I arrived early so the staff kindly helped me use thr library which was very comfortable until the room could be allotted.
The food is the best. The chef is amazing and we enjoyed Srilankan and International cuisine. The juices so fresh and we just couldn't get enough of the food. It is so good that we never wanted to eat outside even though the hotel is conveniently located near so many bars and restaurants. The desserts are not only visually appealing but super tasty.
We used the SPA, this needs improvement definitely but I am sure they can in due course.
On the rooms, good size and amazing views of the Indian Ocean and the beach is lovely. 
The staff is lovely like all people in Srilanka.
However, the bathroom door is all glass opens towards the bedroom, generally in hotels bathroom doors entry is through the foyer area. 
There is a blind that you have to keep rolling up and down incase u need to get in and out of the bathroom. Very inconvenient. If there is scope, they should work on improving this as this causes a lot of inconvenience while sharing the room and at night could be disturbing with rolling up and down of the blinds to get in and out of the bathroom.","Great stay","2024-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r941363751-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","128247816","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","50","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/a4/e8/08/smitagoel.jpg","450",,,,,,,,,,"27","47","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smitagoel","smitagoel","77C289C32A2EE740119D8B1431959598",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","smitagoel"

Everything was amazing from start to finish and we would 100% go back. The nicest hotel in Hikkaduwa by far and a true 5 star.

We arrived at 8am off our flight and they offered us a complimentary breakfast when we arrived. You could not fault the hotel staff in any way, they were always so helpful and friendly. They allowed us to use the reception phone when our flight was cancelled which was very kind.

Our room was beautiful and always replenished with towels, toiletries and well cleaned every day. The pool area was amazing, super clean and well maintained. Special thanks to the man at the pool (not sure of his name) who we made great friends with over the 5 days and always accommodated us with beds before we even asked.

We ate in all of the restaurants and the food was of very high standard, not a bad meal once. The homemade granola qt breakfast was particularly delicious! We booked the Romantic Getaway, had a bottle of wine on arrival, a gorgeous 5 course meal at the pool and an excellent 30 minute couples massage. 

The hotel is located in a quieter part of the beach which we loved as we strolled down to the other bars/restaurants in the evenings. The view from the rooftop bar is incredible and it was lovely relaxing vibes. 

Highly recommend this hotel!

If you are looking for the perfect get away to enjoy the beautiful Sri Lankan coastline, then make sure to book in at Riff Hikkaduwa. 

The bright and airy lobby welcomes you to the hotel, with views of the infinity pool and ocean greeting you as you arrive. A nice fresh fruit juice was given to us as we checked in, before being shown to our rooms. 

The focus on sustainability and natural feel is evident throughout the hotel. With lots of natural light and soothing decor. The rooms are large and spacious and well stocked with all the amenities that you require. Laundry prices are very reasonable and our room attendants did a fantastic job at keeping our room clean and tidy during the stay.

Throughout the stay we were welcomed by the amazing staff, Bashiyna was one of the ladies who was our waitress throughout and her beautiful smile and warm personality made our breakfasts, lunches or dinner a delight. 
The menu offers a selection of Western and local dishes giving plenty of options to try. The Japanese restaurant on the roof top provides high quality dishes for all tastes!

The staff on reception were very help in arranging a few tours for us, one to Galle and one to Udawalawe National Park. Both drivers were very kind and a wealth of information about what we were seeing and explaining local traditions and cultures to us. They also arranged our return journey to the airport in Colombo. 

The hotel is on the beach, meaning that you can easily go for walks down the beach to surf or visit Turtle Beach. 

As we were statying over New Year, we were lucky to be part of the NYE celebrations at the hotel. The hotel provided an amazing evening, with a extensive buffet, drinks, music and traditional dances. All the staff worked so hard to pull off the evening, and we are grateful for their efforts. 

Every member of staff, from the owner, general manager, waiters/ waitresses etc were incredibly friendly and welcoming. We left feeling like friends! 

The hotel had a mixture of families and couples staying, making it the perfect get away for everyone. We left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated, 
We will definitely be returning to this incredible hotel

The food wasn’t great but our “terrible” review comes from our mistreatment. The service was dreadful, taking over and hour to receive a brownie (which was very similar to a supermarket brownie in the UK), my friend didn’t receive cutlery before her food (a bolognese) was cold (despite many requests) and the mojitos were essentially minty water. We had a very slow waiter who seemed to be unsure of his job and asked us many times what our order was despite writing it down the first time. On completing our food, we simply requested to not pay the service charge or have a slight discount as the service was so poor. The waiter then asked another waiter who, upon hearing our complaint, said it wasn’t his fault as it was busy (the restaurant was not near full) and we should go elsewhere next time if we were so unhappy. Obviously, we then asked for a manager. After telling him the story and saying what this waiter had just said he called the waiter over and asked if this was true, he said not and the manager accused us of lying. He also stated that we couldn’t have any money off as we had consumed the food and not made any complaints. When rebutting the fact we had not complained he stated that due to US not asking for the manager earlier, the whole situation was our fault. We argued this was clearly not good hospitality he became more aggressive and frustrated with us. He then went away and sent over a female employee who upon asking turned out to be an assistant, likely sent over to pacify us with a female approach - we simply asked for the manager back. Eventually, he shouted that if we wanted money off it would come from the waiters salary, which we said would be his choice and that we were happy to take the discount - especially having been there so long and it now being quite a scene. We then waited for a card reader to pay but instead a group of several male workers arrived with an older male at the center claiming to be the manager himself. He acted in a very aggressive and demeaning manner, making us feel quite unsafe and said that we couldn’t have the discount promised just minutes earlier. We did then complain to him but began to feel as though we were being threatened with an ultimatum and he gave the impression he would be ready to hit us. For our safety we then paid and left, feeling as though had we not do so things could have been very bad. Most frustratingly we all felt had we had a male friend with us we may have not been treated with such disrespect and lack of dignity. This ruined one of my friends’ last nights in Sri Lanka!

This hotel is on a busy road but once inside the hotel it is fabulous. The views from most rooms are amazing ,the only noise you can hear is the waves crashing onto the the coral reef. We booked half board and the food was always fresh .hot and tasty. The chefs are always out checking that everything is topped up so nothing is ever left empty. The staff hear are just the best. All of the staff including gardeners , security etc will give you a bit Sri Lankan smile and always want to make your day special. The reception team especially Jayaru the fabulous customer relations young lady was amazing and is a credit to the hotel. A big thank you too for the help and support from Pubuda and Mr Desiva for our general welfare during our stay. They checked up on us every day to make sure that we had no problems or concerns. There is very few hotels in the world that try so hard to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel has many shops and bars close by with no hard sale from staff. The area around has every thing needed. The town Hikkaduwa is not massive and not silly busy. great shops .lovely stretches of beach and lovely friendly locals always wanting to chat. People have complained about the gap year students coming to the hotel . They are great kids, doing brilliant unpaid help in Sri Lanka and they deserve a few hours fun on there afternoons of They never caused any problems and actually made the hotel buzz . The people complaining in my opinion are out of order having fun is not a crime. Please do not stop coming to this beautiful hotel because of a few people who want hotels to be like libraries. We have promised the staff that we will be back to stay again and we will definitely keep our promise. Try it for your selves and hope you have a wonderful stay like our 3 weeks. A big Thank you to all of the wonderful staff  and management that contributed  to making our stay so brilliant and memorable and we will see you all again .","wonderful small piece of Sri Lanka","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r961135235-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"295986779",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoobyWestYorkshire","scoobyWestYorkshire","318470990D80EFC8DD38AC539F9A6E46",,,,,"scoobyWestYorkshire"

We came to Citrus hotel for dinner in their dining area, expecting average food and service for the rating that the hotel has. We were greeted by a young waitress who seemed inexperienced and didn’t know how to speak English, as we waited 20 mins to get the menu. In an almost empty dining area, we waited for our food for about 35 mins (bearing in mind we are already here for over an hour), got half of our main courses and 10 minutes after our meal we got our drinks. My friend waited an additional 30 minutes for her meal after we got ours (she just ordered a portion of fries). 

All in all, the experience was not a decent one, especially since half of the people were vegetarian and asked for vegetarian meals to which they only informed us half an hour later that they don’t have (they had at least 4 vegetarian options on the menu). A disappointing evening and I feel wrong for spending our last night here.","A disappointing evening with bad service","2024-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r960070646-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","452391441","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522kylaw","Kyla W","7EFFEDBB39BC37FABD44B66E31DB031F",,,,,"522kylaw"

Since it was a Saturday, a local holiday, the hotel was bustling with guests, both local and foreign. This large crowd might have overwhelmed the staff, as the restaurant was constantly packed, making it difficult to even get a glass of water.
Despite the crowded atmosphere, the room itself was comfortable and cozy, albeit lacking an elevator, which could be a concern for some guests. The staff, however, were friendly and helpful.
One unsettling aspect of the stay was the presence of stray cats wandering around the restaurant area, seemingly ignored by the staff. Additionally, a crow managed to enter the restaurant and snatch food from a plate. These hygiene concerns detracted from the overall experience.
While the hotel's location and room comfort were positive aspects, the overcrowded atmosphere, limited service, and hygiene issues require improvement.

Even though we reached the hotel late after travelling the entire day from Ella but the smiles on the front office staff put all our tiredness to rest. Check-in was breeze - Thanks to ever-smiling Naomi at the reception - gave us 3 adjoining rooms with amazing sea view. 

Loved the pool. The Pool time is 7:30 to 7:30 however must thank the staff who, upon enquiring, was willing to open the pool even after 7:30pm - very accommodating staff. 

Though the entrance t o the room is facing the road but once you are inside the room - the sea view is mesmerizing.

The Resturant and the bar on the beach has good vibes and the staff is really helpful., they suggested some local brew and I was surprised how good they tasted.

For the breakfast - The Resturant has limited options, apart from Sri Lankan breakfast. I would be nice if they can add a few dishes to the breakfast.

It's a pity we did not get the time to enjoy the hotel facilities - but I will surely stay for a longer period next time.

Overall a good experience.","Good hotel - right at the beach","2024-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r957629082-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","457940457","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/4b/9d/e9/82arnoldm.jpg","1280","44","95","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82arnoldm","Arnold#Cr8ive","ED0C60793B9FCF7D72963D67E7221093",,"21","Middle East","Middle East","82arnoldm"

The AC in the room was very noisy as was the road noise which started early in the morning.
The food was good in my opinion and the biggest compliment to this hotel is the staff. All of which were friendly and are an asset.
My main problem with this hotel is the managers idea to allow gap year students in to use the facilities. Pool and sunbeds and towels. 
Generally taking over all areas and not spending any money buying food or drink. 
The hotel is not looking after the paying guests but letting them take all of the sunbeds and towels provided.
Well out of order.

at a different hotel",,,,,,,,,,,,,"

It is very rare that I have to log a full complaint about the standard of a hotel. We are very accepting of most things and tolerate a lot.

However, with regret we feel we have no choice but to take this matter further. 

Before I go on, both the hotel and Mercury Holidays are fully aware of our problems and despite being asked to sort them on numerous occasions, they have done NOTHING to help, even when I gave them a very cheap solution.  

Mold in the shower
Mould in the bathroom
Mould around the aircon, very dangerous
General Mould in other areas of the hotel
Cracked tiles around the pool
Dirty pool towels
Plaster/render coming off walls
And so it goes on.

The hotel also allows non paying guests, mainly gap year students, to come into the hotel and use the sunbeds and facilities. The theory is they buy food and drink in return, but they don't. They just make it almost impossible for paying guests to get sunbeds. We also have to put up with screeching and giggling constantly. As one guest said, it's like we are part of a university campus. Even the students say they can't believe they can use the facilities for free.

But that all pails into insignificance when it comes to Wednesday and Thursday night. A night billed as Karaoke entertainment for the hotel guests. But that's not the case. Wednesday and Thursday nights are when over 100 of the students descend on the hotel. They get drunk, jump in the pool in their underwear (mainly girls), and then run through the hotel, making the floors wet and generally causing mayhem. Point to note: The pool closes at 19.00hrs for paying guests, but has no time limit for non paying guests

As for the actual karaoke, this gets totally taken over by the students. The noise is so loud from their shouting that you can't use the restaurant. They also take over the bar so we can't get a drink. Point to note: The bar closes at 23.00hrs for paying guests, but 23.30 or later for non paying guests

Some nights, the management think that the best solution is to move paying guests and put them in a conference room for dinner so that the students can still enjoy themselves. The conference room is basically a box with no windows.

A point to note, there is only one bar and one restaurant at the hotel and they are attached to each other and with lovely sea views. The conference room is a box with no windows and one door.

The complaints the hotel have received are constant and plentiful. The management and guest relations openly admit that all nationalities are complaining. But they do nothing to help the paying guests. I have spoken to the management right up to the main general manager. Whilst they sympathise, they say they can't do anything because they need the extra money.

The hotel has a 5 star sister hotel. I suggested they could move paying guests there for the remainder of the holiday. The Mercury rep and Mercury head office said we could move, but only if we paid the difference. With other tour operators they would sort it, and pay the difference if needs be. Not tell the client to sort it

I complained again to both the rep and Mercury. And again we asked to be moved. But the response was the same, you can ask the hotel if they will move you, but there's nothing we can do!!!  REALLY!!! I pointed out to Mercury that our contract is with them and as such it is they who need to sort our problems.

On the penultimate night, they implemented what I had repeatedly suggested and moved the Karaoke to the conference room. However, this has a flipside. It now means hotel guests have no evening entertainment for 2 nights a week whilst the hotel entertains the students and neglects it's guests. Basically the non paying students are more important than it's paying guests

Honestly this whole experience has been quite possibly the worst ever. We have NEVER stayed in a hotel that puts non paying people, before their paying guests. On a positive, the staff, food and drink are all fantastic. It's a shame they are let down by management that are more interested in running a cabaret bar than a hotel

hotel guest we could not sit in the bar area or get a drink unless edited went to get it for us some guest went to their rooms or went out this is every Wednesday and Thursday complained to managing director who did move guest in the the ball room for Dinner but we were still subjected to this when we had finished Dinner hotel seems more interested in bringing money by any means with out considering hotel guest already paid these students beers using the facilities during the day who seem to think it great to take your Towels this made me feel a little uneasy to leave other belongings around would not return or recommend this hotel","Stay

Rooms and the toilets are quite old and small.
 First day dinner was not to our expectation, Samapth front office Manager was  nice enough to listen to our remarks and checked wit us constantly about the improvement in food, for our surprise from the next meal onwards  all the dishes complimented  well with each other and there was a variety. this hotel has a beautiful sea shore very close to the hotel and what we loved the most was the high table made in cement and the high chairs on the sea shore , sipping mocktails and cocktails listening to the sounds of the waves and sea salt breeze.. Loved that experience... even at 10pm we were in the beach chatting away walking in the water. Mano De Silva, General Manager was welcoming and ensured we had a pleasant holiday. Both Sampath & Mano always with a smile, staff was friendly and helpful.","Great stay !!

enjoyed our 4 night all inclusive stay post our tour around Sri Lanka.

Check in was swift and we were given a room with lovely views on top floor. The room had a large balcony with views of beach and pool. 

Room was quite spacious with flat screen TV with many satellite channels. There was a fridge, kettle, safe deposit box and plenty of storage. Bathroom had a walk in shower. It was small but adequate. 

Food in dining room was generally good but limited vegetarian choices were on offer on some days. However the chef was happy to prepare other vegetarian dishes which I did order on a couple of days.

There was only 1 bar by the restaurant and they had a range of local beers, wines, spirits and cocktails on offer for all inclusive guests. I would have preferred another bar near the reception area. Also there was limted seating near reception area. Would have liked more indoor seating areas which would be useful on rainy days. 

However the beach was nice and turtle beach was only 5 minutes walk away where we got to see turtles on a couple of days. Also one could swim at turtle beach. Swimming was not allowed on beach opposite hotel when we were there due to rough seas.

Pool was small but adequate. It was constantly kept clean by pool attendant who was friendly. The team at reception was very friendly too and looked after all our needs.

Outside the hotel, there were plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. There is also a supermarket directly opposite the hotel.

Evening entertainment was generally low key but pleasant. However on one evening they had a DJ who played bollywood/Sri Lankan music and everyone danced away despite the heavy rain outside. 

We would be happy to visit this hotel perhaps in the drier season. However I would like the hotel to add another bar area and more indoor seating areas for their guests.","4 nights pleasant beach stay after our week long tour of Sri Lanka!","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r951908857-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","69939368","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","153","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","336","2056","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/2b/30/a8/rishigudka.jpg","1536",,,,,,,,,,"79","255","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rishigudka","rishigudka","EA0A231EE43E04922463C31820E59340",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","rishigudka"

Everything from the location, to the rooms, to the staff to the food was amazing.
I couldn’t fault it. 
We stayed in one of the sagosa ocean rooms and it met our expectations and more. We had a welcome basket of fruit & sweet treats. There is a plunge pool on the balcony with 2 comfortable lounging chairs and a relaxing day bed. 
The bathroom is open to the elements but private. 
There is an endless supply of water bottles. Given it was our anniversary we had a cake and they lit our room with tea lights before we retired. A lovely touch. 
The first night we had supper on the beach which was a delight. 
The food is excellent and obviously the fresh fish is a speciality. The second evening I had Sri Lankan fish curry with rice served with all its multiple vegetable curries. Absolutely delicious but filling as always . 

The pool is a good size and the area is great to relax and unwind and you can get to the beach easily and watch the sunsets. 

The staff are incredibly friendly and always want to please. I didn’t want to leave and 2 nights certainly wasn’t enough.","Wonderful relaxing luxury beach hotel","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r937501212-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","452388731","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","1","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marypL5265RX","Mary P","2CBF86F4B4D90930E2BC5F3BC9F66299",,,,,"marypL5265RX"

Aditya holds a real charm of its own with insightful art pieces, timeless furniture and unparalleled character. The food was delicious and our room was incredibly cosy (leaving was a struggle). We will be back for sure and do thank all of the staff for creating such a wonderful holiday!","Restful Getaway, Top-class Experience","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r936895247-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","727495686","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","205","315","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","315","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/5c/b4/06/leiahamza.jpg","450",,,,,,,"1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiahamza","Leia Hamza","ADBF6A4305AF7598F8D34B33932E08DE",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","leiahamza"

The hotel is beautifully located on a long empty beach and is tucked away in beautiful grounds. The rooms are outstanding and ours had a plunge pool and courtyard garden. The Hotel pool is warm and a good size with plenty of sun bed options. What makes this hotel special though are the staff who were absolutely fantastic and attentive. But not in an intrusive manner…. The restraunt food was first class with a limited but excellent menu. Again the service here was superb with a final night meal on the beach that was just lovely. A great stay and hope to return again someday.

The rooms are so stylish with lovely courtyard leading to outside bath. Fantastic outside bathroom with such lovely space and feel. 
Staff are so helpful and service brilliant. 
We ate all our meals at the hotel. Breakfast was flexible allowing us to eat anytime before noon.

The hotel location is great. The staff is friendly but the front office crew needs to be more pleasant with the visitors because compared with the other hotels we visited, we didn't get the welcome that we expected. This place has a very nice beach and it is very clean and also they have a good swimming pool. The room was too small and had a partial sea view. They have less variety of foods but the foods are super delicious. Special Thanks should go to Mr David(who might be the F&B manager) who is a very smiley and friendly person and the entire restaurant crew. Overall the stay is good but this place needs to be improved and renovated.","Nice Stay @ Hikka.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r950744953-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","769869455","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e3/46/8f/caption.jpg","1280","23","176","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajitha_wijekoon","rajitha_wijekoon","3D6C7DAD0F5627508FC7A3DBF4B5B85D",,"1051532","Bandarawela, Sri Lanka","Bandarawela","rajitha_wijekoon"

The check-in process was smooth, and we are grateful to Damith, Sandun, Nadun, and the front office team for accommodating our requests. Damith was extremely helpful and ensured that our stay was unforgettable.

The children had a fantastic time playing in the sea, soaking up the sun, and building sandcastles.

The food, cocktails, and service were all excellent. A big thank you to the chef and his team (Nimal, Thilina, Nandana, Nuwan, Sampath, Chinthaka, Gerad, Kaushalya, & Sathsarani).

Looking forward to our next visit!

There was always a good choice of food in the restaurant every day  and the staff were always  helpful-  special mention to Chinthaka who was always so attentive to us and made the dining experience so much  more enjoyable - Thank you  ! He is a real asset to the hotel . Also a mention to Gerard in the restaurant . The hotel location is great-  direct access to the beach and across the road from a large supermarket .

A very special mention must be made of two members of the breakfast/restaurant team: Nandana and Avis(h)ka. They truly surprised us with their service and attention. Thank you so much.
Thank you also to the water sports coach for helping us out with our 'towel conundrum'. 🫣

The rooms were clean and spacious and we all had lovely views of the sea from our rooms. Breakfast was fantastic with lots of local dishes and plenty of veg options too. Location is just perfect as it's spot-bang in the middle of Hikka main toad, with everything within walking distance.

Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your stay at our hotel. We appreciate your feedback as it helps us improve our services.

Regarding the additional 20% charge you mentioned, we would like to clarify that this consists of two mandatory taxes imposed by the Sri Lankan government: Value Added Tax (VAT) of 18% & a Special Consumption Levy (SSCL) of 2% tax.
We understand that these taxes can sometimes be unexpected, but they are legally required by the government. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We are glad to hear that you enjoyed the food, staff, and location. We will continue to strive to provide excellent service to all of our guests.

Thank you again for your feedback.

The rooms were pretty ordinary, not much to get excited about, as they felt old and outdated. However, the staff were nice and went out of their way to make my stay comfortable, which I appreciated. On the downside, the food had its issues from time to time, mostly due to a lack of communication between the kitchen and restaurant staff. Despite this, I did enjoy the dinner at the Crab Shack—big kudos to the team there.

As a solo traveler, I was placed in a room next to families with young children, which I didn’t particularly enjoy.

Overall, I would give this hotel 3 stars.","Reasonable Stay","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r965968300-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","714658673","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/98/d3/71/darnleyjv.jpg","1280","1","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darnleyjv","Darnley J Van","C970BCC9FECE771D09686C67B2E0C3EB",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","darnleyjv"

He would make us feel extremely comfortable and kept my family happy and topped up with drinks. The staff were very helpful, kind and generous as mostly everyone is in Sri Lanka. Our hotel felt very secure and the security were everywhere and very alert as it is quite an open space. The buffet had a variety of foods that everyone would like, and if you did not like any food you were able to ask for food that they made fresh.  The hotel was in an amazing location where the turtles were literally on your doorstep but as we came here off season it was very wavey so on a rare occasion we saw the turtles. Although we did see them atleast on 3 of the days. I can imagine that in seasons the turtles come to shore. This hotel was very quiet as we came in August, and was so chill and calm which we enjoyed. Even though it was not summer season, it was still a great

My daughter got sick during the trip, vomiting and having diarrhea, and couldn't eat anything. She just wanted to eat the soup made by her mother. On the first day of breakfast, I prepared to bring a plate of tomatoes and green leafy vegetables to the room to make soup for my daughter. Renuka told me that guests are not allowed to bring food back to the room by themselves, but can ask the service staff to deliver it. Soon someone delivered the tomatoes and green leafy vegetables to the room. Since I couldn't find a supermarket to buy ingredients, I went to the restaurant at noon the next day to ask for some tomatoes and potatoes. I met Renuka again. She told me that the restaurant has a rule that guests cannot take away ingredients at will. I understood it very well and told her about my daughter's illness. She was very enthusiastic to help me apply and find a way, and finally sent the tomatoes and potatoes to the room.
In a foreign country, my daughter got sick. As a mother, I was very worried and anxious. Renuka helped me. I am very grateful to her.
At the same time, I also want to thank the guard. When we were anxious to find a hospital, he told me that there was a newly opened hospital 5 minutes away. It was great. We got there in time, and my daughter received treatment and recovered in time. He asked about my daughter many times, which made me feel warm. Unfortunately, I was so anxious that I forgot to ask his name.
I feel care and warmth here,not indifference and neglect. thank you very much. my family will keep this in our hearts, pass on this beauty to more people.","warm Renuka and guard","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r963880166-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","452389098","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindasI2170HD","linda s","552235841DBF7D322A32DD0A6431786C",,,,,"lindasI2170HD"

The hotel is gorgeous, with breathtaking sea views that made my stay so relaxing. Waking up to the ocean right outside my window was definitely the best part.

The buffet at the hotel was another highlight. There was so much to choose from, and everything I tried was delicious. Whether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the food was always fresh and super tasty.

But what really made my stay special were two awesome staff members, Vishmi and Ravindu. Before I even got there, I worked with Vishmi to book my stay, and she was fantastic. She made sure everything was set up perfectly for me and really took care of everything. 

Overall, my stay totally exceeded my expectations. The views, the food, and most of all, the amazing staff like Vishmi and Ravindu made this stay I won’t forget. I highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to come back!","Stay was fantastic!","2024-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d579245-r963007914-Hikka_Tranz_by_Cinnamon-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","452389422","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wishvam2024","Wishva M","6A83BA691CB2DD650F313F5FB4A3D022",,,,,"wishvam2024"
