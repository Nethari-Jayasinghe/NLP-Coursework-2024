Kandalama offers an exceptional experience surrounded by nature and stunning views, making it a beautiful getaway. The staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful, which seems to be a hallmark of this place. They go above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and attended to at every moment. The location itself is breathtaking, with lush surroundings and views that seem to blend the architecture seamlessly into the natural landscape. The boat ride offered by the hotel is an absolute must-do, providing a unique perspective on the area and a peaceful escape.

The food at the Main Restaurant was another highlight. Every meal was delicious, with an impressive variety and a great balance of local and international dishes. It truly added to the luxury experience, and it’s clear the culinary team puts a lot of effort into their craft.

On the downside, there were a couple of areas that could be improved. There was a 35-minute delay in the check-in process, which was a bit frustrating after a long journey. Additionally, the TV positioning in the 317 Suite room felt awkward, making it difficult to watch from the bed comfortably.

Overall, Heritance Kandalama is a fantastic destination with a few minor setbacks, but the beautiful setting, friendly staff, excellent food, and relaxing boat ride more than make up for it.","Average","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r978210917-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Check-in was swift, and we were welcomed with refreshments upon arrival.
The hotel had a museum-like ambiance, and the wildlife was incredible, with monkeys greeting us on our balcony each morning.

The pool, which closes at 8 PM, provided a lovely spot for stargazing in the evening.
Our room was comfortable, with a cozy bed.

The bathroom was nice, they have a bath jacuzzi overlooking the forest and wildlife. 
Breakfast was fantastic, offering a wide variety of choices.

Negative:
Where the bathroom had a jacuzzi, the shower was also part of it. You would need to climb into the jacuzzi to take a shower. This could be a health and safety issue, as it got slippery and they did not provide bath mats and enough towels, this ought to change for those guest who won’t be able to easily manoeuvre themselves into the tub.

The master light switches were behind the bed frame, this was an awkward position and not all the light worked when we first got into the room, we had to get engineers in.

Unfortunately, most of the staff (except those at breakfast) seemed quite unhappy and indifferent.

There was a lack of care in service. My friend ordered two drinks, but there was a misunderstanding, and no apology was offered. She also ordered a sandwich, which arrived about 30 minutes after my food, even though a table of eight, who ordered after us, received their meals first. Again, no apology was given. This was quite disappointing.","Nice hotel, service was ok..","2024-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r972526121-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The hotel is reputedly one of the best in Sri Lanka, the jewel in the crown of the Aitken Spence Hotel group. Opened in 1995, it was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural environment; in this it succeeds very well.

However, the hotel is suffering from under investment and once away from the reception, bar and restaurant areas, this is very noticeable. And the room we were given also showed signs of dilapidation: very stained loo, cracked tiles on the floor and shower of the bathroom, no chrome left on the taps, a very scuffed bedroom  floor and furniture that looked as old as the hotel. 

We booked a Luxury Panoramic King bedroom at just over £200 per night incl Breakfast. The room was large with a wide balcony and an amazing view from the 7th floor of the Dambulla wing. Our King bed however was two twins pushed together with a groove down the middle (this was not what we expected or paid for), there was no safe in the room (one was installed a day later) and no physical information about the hotel anywhere in the room. We downloaded pdf files from their app but there was no pdf map of the hotel, no Beverage menu (just wine and cocktails) and no information at all about restaurant opening/closing times or which menu related to which dining area. In addition, there were no price or information at all about their main buffet dining restaurant. 

Our check-in experience was awful. We arrived just before 2pm after a very long drive. We finally were allowed to gain access to our room at 3.25pm. In the meantime we were not offered any drinks or snacks whilst we waited (why not???) so we ordered a very poor sandwich from room service for an exorbitant $15.5 excluding taxes and service charge. 

Breakfast was good although the buffet restaurant was crowded with queues for freshly prepared food and the service was hit or miss. Personally I hate buffet dining so we avoided the $24 per head (excluding taxes and service charge) and ate in their Asian restaurant which was much more personal, far less busy and the food pretty good. Imali our server there was wonderful and staff were generally good. 

Prices of food and drink are not cheap here (or indeed throughout Sri Lanka in 5* tourist hotels and restaurants). We holidayed in Japan in 2023 and found it far better value than Sri Lanka despite the fact typical Sri Lankans hotel workers earn around £2,400 pa. It made me wonder if Tourists and staff are being exploited to the benefit of shareholders...

In our first 48 hours we engaged with management on several occasions. They tried to improve our experience but after multiple conversations we just accepted our fate and tried to enjoy our stay as best we could. (Writing this last sentence is not a great advert for this hotel on which the Heritance brand has been built over 30 years and which the Aitken Spence group have subsequently expanded across the region). 

At check-out, the bill for food and drink was correct but there was no recognition of our unhappiness with our stay (why not???). However, at my request, they ended up deducting the cost of that awful sandwich.","Not luxury or 5*","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r971668767-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

I commend your guests relations executive Apsara who  was very efficient attentive and very knowledgeable about the history of the hotel.  Visit with her around the hotel was very educational.  Her committed service is an asset to your organisation.

Must add all the staff were very polite friendly and  pleasant .
The only Dowsnide is the standard of food.  Kandalama was known as one of the best hotels when it came to food. I always left the hotel in the past taking with me that unique taste.  I understand Cheff’s have changed over the years.  The standard of food this time was no different to just another 5* buffet which is not great.  The selection and spread was fine but the taste of what ever I had has dropped tremendously.  That is sad and hope the management can raise the standards to what it used to be.

The restaurant meals were one of the best we've experienced in an outside Colombo hotel, and although the arrival meal was a set menu, we were not disappointed at all. Food presentation on the À la carte menu was excellent -  Kudos to the chefs. 

The Arrival Porch at the entrance does not have a canopy, and as it rained heavily when we arrived, it was not a pleasant experience with staff getting our luggage in umbrellas, not to mention our own movement. The TV (relatively small size, old display) and in-house (CATV) entertainment channels is in need of a dire upgrade. 

The view of the lake from the restaurant was beautiful to say the least, as well as the view from the infinity pool. and we would certainly recommend to another.

Great food at both the buffet and a la carte. Three swimming pools in different areas gave plenty of space.
There was music outside one evening played by guy with a flute, sat on a hill; which really made an ethereal impression. 
The calm and relaxed atmosphere of the environment and  staff was somewhat marred though, as at times noisy renovation work was being carried out on two floors during the day. 
Also we had a room facing the trees which made the room quite dark. Overall though we really enjoyed our stay there.","Beautiful setting next to lake","2024-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r952570320-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Cons: 
1. The doorman made our luggage broken while unloading it from the car. (It’s a Rimova, but we can send it back to be repaired with fees after we finish this trip, so we didn’t ask for any compensation)

2. Monkey came in the room through the balcony and flipped our luggage, took away one bag of underwear. It was the housekeeping to be blamed, because we departed for day trip at 10 am that day, they did the housekeeping after we left, and when we came back to the room, we found it terrible, the balcony door was opened, our luggage was flipped out, sugar bags are opened and many ants are on the table, our herb medicine was opened as well, the monkey even tried some of these herb medicine, meanwhile, on the bed there was a nice note left by the housekeeping men, which is funny because it proved that this was not our bad.

3. Insufficient sincereness. Once after we checked in, I found the room in the lowest floor with hardly no views, I just asked the staff that if it was possible to change to a higher floor, the staff seemed to answer me immediately, even with no thinking: “no, this type of room you booked is only in 2nd floor”. I bought in at that time. But after the Monkey Accident, I requested to change a room, they led me to a 4-floor room, I found this new room was totally the same type( same size, same layouts) as the one I was offered in the first day, which made me feel upset because it shows the hotel's insincere attitude and service towards customers.

Follow ups with the Monkey Accident, the hotel insisted that this was the first time that they have encountered such accident, but I don’t believed it because there are Monkeys everywhere in the Hotel area, but I understand, it’s harder for them to just admit the fault","Monkeys are not cute","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r951924879-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Gorgeous view, grounds, architecture and nice facilities (pools, spa, gym, bird walks etc). But the hotel is really tired, the food is so-so (watery coffee, one-sided toast, usual hotel buffet fare), and the rooms are by now old and faded (though clean). Sagging mattresses, greying sheets, over-bath shower that floods the floor, etc. I've been coming to Kandalama for years now - it used to be a high class, luxury hotel that was known for its food. Now it's more geared towards the mass tourism market - lots of huge coach tours, high volume / low cost food, minimal expenditures on maintenance. Lovely staff, but very young and untrained. With a bit of investment it could be good again, but for now, it'd be wise to manage your expectations.

The panoramic views from my room were absolutely breathtaking, offering a mesmerizing sight of the lake along with the beautiful forest. From sunrise to sunset, each moment spent gazing out of the window felt straight out of a fairytale.

Moreover, the customer service was impeccable. I must mention again LALITH who recognized us from the moment I stepped into the lobby, went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable, attending to every request promptly and with a gracious demeanor. He is an absolute treasure to the resort with so much knowledge and hospitality. Also special thanks to the sweet stewardess maduwanthi who was always pleasant and Munasinghe from Housekeeping who helped my mother get some plants.

However, I must mention the food could improve a lot. It was much better the last time we visited. I regret to say that the steak was a dismal disappointment. What was promised as a succulent, flavorful dish arrived overcooked, devoid of any taste, and presented without care. Not only did it fail to meet even basic standards of preparation, but the lack of concern from the staff regarding our dissatisfaction further soured the experience. (Which is the reason I’m only leaving 4 stars) I would say food other food items were good but lacked in flavor. 
The SEER FISH from dinner buffet was a 10/10 and should give credit for that.

Overall, I highly recommend this lovely hotel for anyone seeking a combination of stunning views and exceptional customer service.","A Tale of Two Experiences: Pleasant Stay, Culinary Letdown.","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r950720990-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Pools were lovely , it’s a shame they close so early , a swim after a big day touring here would have been nice.
Staff very nice .

The layout and design is very clever as the hotel blends into its surroundings. 
On our two night visit, we found the hotel staff to be courteous and polite. It is very heavily staffed and needs to be as it’s a very busy hotel. Constant arrivals and departures. 

The room outlook was spectacular and it was spacious. It was showing many signs of wear and tear though. A squeaking bed to poor decorative patching in the bathroom to a heavily marked floor + other areas that need improvement. We looked at another room and it was also showing signs of heavy wear. The room looks tired. 
The room servicing was to a very high standard though and special thanks to the housekeeper. 

For a hotel charging this money, the service needs to be more accurate and consistent. Some examples:
the menus for the hotel are viewable via a QR code in the room - you are told to scan on arrival. The menus are wrong. 
The service around the pool can be slow and inattentive. 
The standard of the evening buffet was poor  quality for vegetarians. 
It is wrong to asks guests to pack and vacate their room when the room has been paid for until the evening. Especially when confirmed at booking in time. 
The tax on alcohol is 38% in addition to the menus prices, so be aware! 

Overall we were not impressed with this hotel considering rating qualification and the price. 
The attitude of the staff is not in question. More a training requirement, some modernisation to rooms and an overall effort by all the hotel management to ensure detail is correct.","Amazing setting and deserving of a better guest experience.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r946496317-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The best part of the property is the view it offers and the bridge made to connect the two wings. 
Talking about food, they have lavish spread with loads of varieties including Indian vegetarian options for the buffet. The staff is really helpful and willing to go to extra mile to make you comfortable. Special mention to Mr Budhika (restaurant and bar manager) who took special care of us. 

Few scope of improvements - 
1. there is only one lift common for passengers and service. Sometimes can be time consuming. 
2. Kids area can have few more options

I came by the Sackville Restaurant at the Golden Ridge, can highly recommend the food there as while it is a limited menu, everything I've tried so far is 7/10 and above with the Pasta being 9/10.

The view is lovely and excellent area set up with a birds eye view at the top deck. Golf carts for accessibility as well is great. The overall experience is great so far, I've seen some of the rooms, looks good including the bungalow and apartment style rooms. Would highly recommend.

International buffet breakfast, great quality bars and restaurants, indoor pool and lovely grounds. Clean rooms, ours had a beautiful view overlooking the hotel’s vegetable gardens and out to the mountains. The hotel is still fine-tuning a few service things (meal service time, tea & coffee) but otherwise a lovely experience.","Best hotel in town offering a very comfortable stay","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r958949599-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",
