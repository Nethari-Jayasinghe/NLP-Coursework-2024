The truth is, overall I was disappointed.

The photos on their website and the 5-star rating meant I thought I was booking a luxury stay at the end of our time in Sri Lanka, however that wasn’t the case. A few key things to highlight:

- I was messages on the same day of arrival telling me that the bar and restaurant would be out of use, as they didn’t get their license approved. This may seem small but one of the reasons I book hotels over Airbnb type things is for the hotel vibe, of which these common areas play a big part. Instead we had an empty restaurant area with a closed sign to stare at.

- The hotel itself needs a complete renovation IMO. It’s tired, dated and requires maintenance. It looks great in the photos but in reality it’s very tired. 

 
There were some good points though:

- the young chap on reception and the main go-to was super friendly and accommodating (like every Sri Lankan I’ve met)

- the pool area and beachfront is beautiful

- the location is great. Just a short walk or tuk tuk away is Turtle Bay, which is incredible. A little further but not far is Unawatuna beach and Galle Fort, both worth visiting. 

Overall not a terrible experience but a disappointing one based on expectations set via their website.","Disappointing experience","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d9978106-r967121251-Owl_and_the_Pussycat_Hotel-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","120278616","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","50","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/2b/4e/58/sancar-s.jpg","450",,,,,,,,,,"2","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sancar1983","Sancar S","47776BE0AA74524B7545A6DE83A5B261",,,,,"sancar1983"

It is beautifully appointed, very quiet and the beds are very comfy. The grounds are beautiful and the pool, while much smaller than it looks in photo's, was really nice. 
The service was amazing, however it took forever for the barman to make drinks.
Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed when we stayed. As the hotel is about a 1-2 minute walk down a dark lane way, and there are no restaurants near-by, this meant a good 15 minute walk in the dark, down the alley then along a very busy main road with no footpaths and lots of holes. 
While we absolutely loved the hotel and the staff, we would not stay here again purely due to the location.","Lovely hotel but location let it down","2024-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d9978106-r965808977-Owl_and_the_Pussycat_Hotel-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","452391968","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","1200","0","18","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyrJ9878NQ","Tracey R","624F82B570E412228F666E7B8C1D560A",,,,,"traceyrJ9878NQ"

I booked a suite for 2 nights but could only stay for one. It was non refundable, which was fine, the mistake was mine. I never asked for a refund of any type.

Despite informing the hotel of my new arrival date (and paying for two nights), they were not prepared for my stay and said so. My room air conditioner didn’t work all night (which is a big deal in Sri Lanka). There was no available coffee until the kitchen opened at 7:30 (despite their website stating a coffee machine). No room service. I called about these issues but was told no one was available to help me. 

The worst is the GM blames others for the lack of care and response. Hiccups happen, I don’t mind, but a GM who displaced blame sours everything for travelers and staff alike.

Nearly 1k spent for my 17 hour stay, which could have been a bargain if they were just kind and responsive.","An Unfortunate Stay","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d9978106-r944602791-Owl_and_the_Pussycat_Hotel-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","452392144","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","74","38","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adornalou","Jenna A","C84784323D0B5F3A26384E6970F4FF91",,"60878","Seattle, Washington","Seattle","Adornalou"

In the description of this property on Agoda, it says it is a ""5 star property"". It is by no stretch of the imagination a 5 star or even a 4 star property. It is, at best, a glorified airbnb. We faced a multitude of issues while staying here: 
1. Our room was a “Standard room” with no ocean view. Although the photos depict rooms which are facing some greenery and look pleasant, this is not what the room we were given looked like at all. It was dark and dingy and the “view” was the building behind and the top of a tree. This meant that there was almost no sunlight entering the room which made it quite dark and dingy. For context - a stay a non- sea facing room at Taj Samudra, Colombo (which is an actual 5 star property) has spectacular views. Just cause you can’t afford a room with a view doesn’t mean you get shoved in the back with no sunlight. 
2. This brings me to my next point - this room with no sunlight cost us substantially MORE than our stay at the Taj. We are still not sure about the reason and the basis for this pricing after having seen and stayed at the property. 
3. The room does NOT have any phone/landline. This means you cannot communicate with the reception or ask the staff for help with anything. (Not sure this is the standard permitted in a 5 star property either). If you think this doesn’t matter and you can always go down - we realised what a HUGE inconvenience this was on the first night itself. The rooms are located in separate buildings from the restaurants, reception etc. On our first evening there it started to rain heavily and we were effectively stuck in the room for hours. We were unable to call the reception to borrow an umbrella, to ask for food and drink. 
4. Eventually, we looked up the reception phone number on the internet and called them using our own cell phones. We asked for some tea. They sent us a lukewarm teapot with teabags (which were already available in the room) and some cold milk with two cups. When asked if they could send proper brewed tea (masala chai, etc.) they said they don’t provide this. These might seem like small issues - but these are not issues anyone faces at a 5 star property. (Or even 4 and 3 star properties that we have stayed at)
5. They do not provide in room dining. 
6. The pillows were too thick and uncomfortable to sleep with. 
7. The king/queen size bed did not have one mattress - they had joined up two single bed mattresses. This meant that the middle of the bed had a ridge and this was extremely hard and uncomfortable. If you are two people, you cannot unfortunately sleep close to each other as someone will end up on the middle portion and sleep in pain. 
8. They don’t provide bottled water - they refill a jug every day (which is not preferable) and they have given two glasses which are kept on coasters (which were not the cleanest).
9. When we entered the room we soon realised that this room was part of a larger room and perhaps not even intended to be used a a standalone room. Our room and the one next to ours were separated only by a wooden door which was locked. This meant that all sounds carried across both rooms. When we were trying to sleep at night, the room next door was having a party and we unfortunately had to request them to reduce their volume as the sound was so loud we could not sleep. 
10. The beach next to the hotel is not a swimmable beach - you have to walk down the road for around 10–15 minutes to a beach that you can actually swim at and it is connected to a restaurant. 
11. The staff was polite but fairly clueless. They barely understand any English and could not help with much. (Further elaborated in other points)
12. The breakfast offerings are despicable and miserly. There is some fruit lying around which are covered improperly and flies are flying around. There is some instant coffee (which is the same given in the rooms) and some tea bags. The “continental” breakfast options are quite limited and sad. The omlettes were incredibly heavy, the avocado toast was horrible. (Dinner options were still better). Since tea options weren’t available, we asked for a cappuccino or a latte, we were told that these are charged separately. (Not sure how or why though? We have opted for a plan which includes breakfast). 
13. When we were stranded due to rain we decided to use some of the facilities provided in the hotel, like the TV room (there are no TVs in the individual rooms). However, the TV/satellite cable was not working and when we asked they said they’ll get it repaired the next day.
14. Possibly one of the worst things was that when we asked the staff for advice on how to travel around (e.g., go to Galle which is a small town around 8-10km away), we were told that we can take the tuk-tuks standing outside. We asked what kind of a price we should expect to pay and we were told one way would cost LKR 2500. This amount is not only ludicrous but we later found out that this is a rate which had been set by the tuk-tuk “mafia” and that it ought to only cost 800-1500 LKR (based on your bargaining abilities). When we spoke to tuk-tuk drivers, we were informed of the “understanding” and overpricing. We were thankfully able to bargain our way through the city, but we did not appreciate being misled. I understand that tourism is a source of income, but that does not give anyone a right to mislead/exploit anyone. At best, the staff could have told us a price range, rather than telling us its fixed. (A simple check on the uber app is a good way of figuring how much it should cost). 
Overall, this is one of the most disappointing stays we have had at any hotel. If you don’t care about any of the things above, go ahead and book this place.","Frustrating and disappointing experience","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d9978106-r944374401-Owl_and_the_Pussycat_Hotel-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","315669109","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","50","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/d0/ba/75/kanika-s.jpg","450",,,,,,,"0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KanikaS239","Kanika S","37A750CD5F81D27DB75328A9B325E43C",,,,,"KanikaS239"

Thank you immensely for taking the time to share your experience at Paragon. 
We are thrilled to hear that your 12-day stay with us was nothing short of exceptional, starting from the moment you arrived at the Colombo airport.
Your kind words regarding our attentive and professional staff mean the world to us. We will certainly pass along your praise to the entire team. 

Our oceanfront pool and garden, along with the tranquil stretch of sea, indeed offer a serene environment for relaxation and rejuvenation. Furthermore, we are honored that you found our Ayurvedic treatments to be excellent and that our yoga and meditation classes contributed to moments of intense well-being. It warms our hearts to hear that you felt pampered throughout your stay and that the benefits of our treatments have lasted even after your return home.

We are truly grateful for your glowing review and for choosing Paragon for your rejuvenating getaway. 
We eagerly await your return next year and look forward to continuing to exceed your expectations.

Warm regards,
Yours Ayurveda Paragon Team

It started our 12-day stay very well.
Excellent well-maintained facility 10 km south of Galle city.
The welcome and explanations by a Hostess immediately put us at ease both for the hotel part and the Ayurvedic treatments: nothing is left to chance and in every way the staff is always available for any information.
All of the staff are attentive and professional: praise to all the staff.
Excellent buffet cuisine with an excellent variation of dishes: twice a week they organize theme nights in the garden by the sea. The service staff also good and attentive both during meals and in serving drinks in the garden.
The outdoor pool in the oceanfront garden and the lounge chairs are an outlet to relax and regain energy after treatments. Unique is the wonderful stretch of sea between the hotel and the ""Reef"" that creates a natural pool of calm, safe water where you can swim among the multicolored fish and corals.
 
The room, we chose a junior suite, was large, clean, well-maintained and ocean view-all rooms have ocean views. On the upper floors the view is better but even on the ground floor, where we were staying, we had the convenience of the front garden.
 
The SPA treatments were always excellent: the well-made facility, the very friendly and professional staff made us spend moments of intense well-being.
And praise must go to the Hostesses who every day, in the morning and late afternoon, accompany you with their wonderful yoga and meditation classes as the sun rose and set over the ocean.
 
It was the perfect stay for a combination of relaxing treatments and yoga.
We would have liked to stay longer but unfortunately we had no more holiday.
We felt pampered from the arrival to the last minute at the airport gate, and the benefit of the treatments we still feel a month after returning home.
We will definitely come back next year to rejuvenate.

This small Boutique Hotel is a true gem worth every 5-stars, nested a short-tuk-tuk ride from Unawatuna or Galle.
The hotel is on a quiet beautiful beach. There are rocks, so you cannot swim directly in from the hotel, but you have a small and beautiful cove 100m on the right. And you can enjoy the view of fishermen on their stilts from the hotel terrace at sunrise and sunset! Spot is perfect for both.
The 4 bedrooms are very large and comfortable, decorated with a lot of style. Beds are 5 stars.
The food was the best we had during our entire stay in Sri Lanka, we had amazing dinners, and probably our best breakfast ever in travel (no buffet, dishes are cooked on-demand). A huge congrats to the chef!!!
The owner Catherine and her staff were extremely careful to our comfort and needs. And we had an amazing NYE dinner and celebration. We highly recommend it and hope to be able to visit again in the future!","A hidden gem in Unawatuna","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d7697108-r935846410-Elysium-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","190740298","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","550","682","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5e/77/4a/carnetsdeyann.jpg","682",,,,,,,"62","148","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarnetsdeYann","CarnetsdeYann","C01689D5654268F9DBB7B4607E432BEF",,"187147","Paris, France","Paris","CarnetsdeYann"

travelled at the end of October, we had some rain but overall the weather was good with lots of sun to enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"What can I say but, ‘Simply Exceptional’, from the moment the gates to the drive open you realise you have arrived somewhere special.

There is a certain serenity that embraces you as you walk down the entrance hall and in to the spacious and perfectly presented lounge and dining area which looks out across your private pool and down to the beach beyond the gardens.

No traffic noise, just nature and the sound of the waves washing across the rocks and on to the beach.

Everything is special here, the location, the villa, the friendly attentive staff dedicated to your every need, the quality and maintenance of everything, the attention to detail, the food, bedrooms and bathrooms are all wonderful.

The villa boasts 7 bedrooms, 4 to the upper floor, 1 to the ground floor and 2 to the garden area, all are very spacious with comfortable beds and ample hanging and storage, all have large en-suite bathrooms with walk in showers and all but the ground floor have a large bath.
The beds are comfortable, all have tv’s with access to Netflix etc. and there is ample hot water, towels and other bathroom essentials.

The happy and smiling staff are always on hand to provide you the ultimate service and the 2 personal chefs create outstanding food to complement the array of cocktails and soft drinks that freely flow.
We were a group of 6 couples visiting for 3 nights and they happily prepared a delicious and off menu BBQ for us on our first evening.

Always important to mention the things that others might see as a negative so, the beach is beautiful but not for swimming, it’s too rough and rocky, that said , if you walk 5 minutes down the beach you’ll find turtle bay where we swam with turtles.
The wine list is ok but is limited, nevertheless, much better than any other we experienced on our 2 week journey across Sri Lanka (if you’ve been here before you will understand that wine is not really the thing in Sri Lanka), so if you’re a wine connoisseur please don’t be disappointed, we all love our wine and made do with a Zin, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.

In summary, if you’re looking for the ultimate chill-out villa in Sri Lanka this is the place, especially if you are a group or family that wants the place to yourselves, you will not get better!

have just spent a fantastic and relaxing 6 days at Sielen Diva. The villa is a modern beach front villa with only 7 guest rooms. We stayed in the Yanai suite which was very spacious and has the biggest bathroom that we have seen in a hotel/villa; and a fantastic view of the beach and sea. It’s so peaceful and relaxing at Sielen Diva we didn’t want to leave.
Unawatuna is only a 5 minute tuk-tuk ride from the villa, Galle is about 25 minutes away. Every morning we woke to the sound of the waves and a fantastic view of the sea through the huge floor to ceiling windows. The food was of an excellent standard, chef Samantha delighted us with both Sri Lankan and western food. Our favourite were the baked crab and also the Sri Lankan lunch.

The villa is large and even though you can share with other guests, you still feel quite separate from others. Food was excellent. Breakfasts were beautiful with lots of choices. We ate lunch  and dinner there a few times with both Sri Lankan and Western choices. We stayed in the upstairs rooms that were large with exceptional views of the ocean and beaches. Service was very good and the villa is a short car or Tuk Tuk trip away from beaches and Galle fort. We did a cooking class was really good.

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a 5star review. We are elated that you have called our villa a 'small haven of luxury'. This is indeed an honour and it was a pleasure serving you during your week stay with us.
We are very fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihiripenna Beach, it is close enough to the bars and restaurants but also far enough that our stretch of beach remains relatively private and quiet. 
Our staff work especially hard to ensure guests have a wonderful stay with us and we thank you for noticing this.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a lovely review and especially for pointing out the details of your stay that you enjoyed. We pride ourselves on our personalised service so your compliment on having ""the most personalised service you will receive at any hotel, anywhere"" is one of the highest compliments we could receive and we are indeed elated. 

The villa was designed to ensure guests can enjoy panoramic views of the Indian Ocean from both the bedrooms and the common areas so we are so glad this was an aspect you enjoyed during your stay with us. We will most certainly pass on your compliments to our entire Villa team. 
We very much hope to be able to welcome your family back to Sielen Diva one day. Please do keep intouch as we love hearing from our guests.

stayed for 2nights at Sielen Diva in the beautiful Mora room. Located on the corner of the first floor, it’s a jaw droppingly large room, with floor-to-ceiling windows and an incredible bathroom. 

The view of the water and the sound of the waves from the gigantic windows is magical. 

The a/c was strong and effective. Much needed in Unnawatuna’s heat. 

The bed was large and comfortable. The room is spacious and the size of some apartments. 

The bathroom is probably the best that I’ve stayed at in the world! Light, and spacious. With a powerful shower where water falls from the 11ft ceiling. 

As there are just 7 rooms, the property never feels busy. There are plenty of dining areas and is a fairly private experience. 

Food at this boutique hotel is a highlight. The menu is delightful and food is delicious. Prices are a tad high for Sri Lanka, but not overly so from an international perspective. 

The pool is warm and spacious. And due to few guests, you can have the pool to yourself most of the time. 

There’s a clean private beach on the property. The seas were rough, but was fine for some beach photos. 

The games room is well-equipped with a pool table, football table, darts board, weights, board games, books and more. It’s very hot though and we couldn’t see a fan or a/c. 

Overall we had a great stay, and wished we could stay longer.","Beautiful room, bathroom and property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review. It is especially important for small family businesses such as ourselves and helps put us on the map. We are deeply honoured you have awarded us a 5star and are thrilled you enjoyed the service offered by our team. They work especially hard to ensure our guest's have a wonderful stay with us. Whilst all our rooms offer panoramic views of the Indian Ocean, the Yanai Suite is a favourite amongst our guests for its size. We will be sure to pass on your compliments to the Villa owner who personally did the interior design of the villa along with the design of the custom made furniture. We are fortunate to have talented Chefs who are very particular with the ingredients they use. We only purchase local, fresh ingredients. Seafood is purchased directly from the fishermen and fruits and vegetables from the local markets. Thank you for noticing that our menu pricing is not overpriced and we are so glad you enjoyed every minute of your stay with us.

They gave us their maximum attention. We stayed in Yanai Suite. The room was extra spacious and the view breaftaking. We really love furnishing and mistly the paintings. All is well organized and very cozy.

The biggest compliments to the chef Thusara who made us  a fantastic catch of the day in salt crust. We can surely state the best we have ever ate made that way! 

Villa worth the price,the only but is prices which are very high. We were amazed with the prices on coffee,juices, soups and salads. Really not a bit overpriced.

But all in all we enjoyed every minute of our stay.","Fantastic stay","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r941390091-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","452390416","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8798PYolgar","Olga R","38236F07EDECBEF014D5906D990E96D5",,,,,"R8798PYolgar"

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review. We are deeply honoured to receive a 5star. We are very fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihiripenna Beach and our team work very hard to ensure our guests have a memorable stay with us.  We will be sure to pass on your compliments to George and the rest of the team. We are so glad you enjoyed our extensive menus and hope you took the opportunity to try dishes off the menu as our Chefs love curating meals specially for each guest.
We very much hope to be able to welcome you back in the future.

Firstly thank you very much for taking the time to leave us such a detailed review on all the things you enjoyed during your stay and for rating us a 5star. Reviews such as yours really help to put small businesses such as ours on the map thus the team are very much appreciative.  

We are so glad we exceeded your expectations. The team prides ourselves on our personalised service and we want each and every guest to leave with the best memories so we are so happy you noticed this during your stay. 

Our Chefs spend a lot of time perfecting their recipes and working on new ones. They are very particular on the ingredients that they use and we only use fresh, local ingredients. We also do not buy from large chain supermarkets but from the small local suppliers, local markets and directly from the fishermen.

Thank you for your feedback on not knowing about the activities that we offer and we apologise for not informing you prior to your arrival. Our internal and external activities are listed on our website but we will be sure to inform guests moving forwards.

We are fortunate to have such a great team who are all so passionate and genuinely love what they do. We are glad that you noticed their efforts and very much hope to be able to welcome you back to Sielen Diva soon. Please do keep in touch as we love hearing from past guests.

Kind regards,
The Sielen Diva

high factor sunscreen, the sun is so strong in the south.  Even with factor 60 block, we burnt! ","Value","5","Location","5","Service","5",,,,,,,"I honestly don’t know where to start, our stay at Sielen Diva was exceptional! 

From the moment we arrived we received excellent customer service, the staff were all extremely personable and their level of service was outstanding.   

We were greeted with a cool towel and welcome drink whilst we checked in.  Our room was lovely and had a gorgeous view of the ocean, the bath overlooking the sea was a nice touch.   

The room was very spacious with a safe box, plenty of space to unpack, robes, hairdryer, toiletries, free water daily and a very comfortable bed. 

We stayed for five nights and were genuinely sad to leave.  With only seven rooms and ten staff members you feel at home here.  We got to know the team at Sielen Diva well, including the security guards and all were excellent! Honestly the service we received from everyone was above anything we have received elsewhere. 

The villa is beautiful, it was very quiet and peaceful. This place gave us a chance to relax and unwind. On two days we even had the pool to ourselves. 

The beach area isn’t private but due to its location, it’s really quiet and feels like your own private beach.  The hotel guard helped us onto the beach and even provided water to rinse our feet to get rid of sand.  One morning after a walk along the beach, he even got beach towels for us, something unprompted but just shows how lovely everyone was and their desire for excellence service. 

In five days, we only had one lunch and one evening meal away from the villa.  Whilst the food was more expensive than outside the hotel and other places we had stayed in Sri Lanka, it was extremely reasonable for the quality and taste.  You can tell the ingredients are all fresh and the team proudly shared how they sourced from local suppliers.  

The menu had a wide range of options, I opted for fish and seafood each time and every meal was delicious.  My husband tried their local chicken curry, which again was delicious.   Personal recommendations would be the hot buttered squid, banana leaf baked fish, chilli crab, the Sri Lankan curries  and even their club sandwich.   

For our last night we asked if the chef could make us the chilli crab, but with prawns or fish, as the sauce is out of this world!  He kindly obliged, recommending prawns and it was so tasty; it was clear how passionate he chef was about this work.   The hotel manager even sourced fresh local bread for us, just to make sure our last meal was special. 

If you want a lively hotel, this is not the place for you.  It’s very quiet and peaceful; on an evening there isn’t any entertainment, just good food and a chance to sit and enjoy the sound of the waves with cocktails.  We tried out the game room one night,  playing pool, which was fun.  The games room was well equipped but looked like it wasn’t used regularly. 

There are some local restaurants near by, within a short walk, but as we loved the villa and enjoyed the food we opted to stay in the Villa most nights. 

We were in bed by 10pm most nights, having Netflix in the room was a nice surprise as we got to watch late night movies.

We went into Galle to watch the sunset, via Tuk Tuk and had dinner there.  Galle is worth a visit and the Villa offers a Galle tour, something I didn’t known until the last day unfortunately. 

Turtle Beach is about 15 min walk along the road.  It’s a great place to see wild turtles and you can even feed them.  Sadly it gets very busy and many Russian tourists were crowding and touching the turtles, ignoring the do not touch signs.  We went early and stayed until about midday, opting to eat at one of the local beachside restaurants. 

We would highly recommend the villa, it’s a taxi or Tuk Tuk away from Unawatuna beach and Galle but that’s what makes it so relaxing.  If Sri Lanka was closer we would make this a regular holiday spot for a week getaway. 

Thank you to the Sielen Diva team who made our stay wonderful.","A slice of Sri Lankan heaven","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r940511216-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","730482070","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/8a/45/96/484gennah.jpg","1280","2","156","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gennah26","Genna Harwood-Armitage","744E0C94F71AA811D74F2409AA508A50",,,,,"gennah26"

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review. We are elated that you enjoyed the service provided by George and the rest of our team. George and the whole team work very hard to ensure every one of our guests have a lovely stay at Sielen Diva and by being a resident only villa, we can ensure we only provide our guests with customised service in a private and tranquil environment. 
We especially thank you for taking the time to detail the highlights of your stay with us. Our Chefs are very particular with the ingredients they use for every one of their dishes and it is especially important to them to only use fresh, local produce. This is why we purchase our produce from the local markets and directly from the fishermen. It is also important for us to support our local community. 
We are elated you enjoyed our Sri Lankan hospitality and do very much hope to be able to welcome you back to Villa Sielen Diva. In the meantime, please do keep intouch as we love hearing from previous guests.

Sielen Diva is a lovely villa in a beautiful location. But what really sets it apart is the outstanding personalised service you get from George and his team. Since this is a boutique hotel of only 7 rooms you will get excellent service and even make a friend or two.

George helped arrange all our trips out (including a lovely Tuk Tuk driver called Laksman) and also took us on a fun early morning excursion to the fish & vegetable market in Galle; Santa and Isuru were always on hand to look after us and chat about life in Sri Lanka; Tusharu created some amazing dishes, often with the catch of the day fresh from the ocean, and gave us a fantastic cooking demonstration; the rest of the team were lovely too and always had a smile. We were also lucky enough to meet the charming owners of Sielen Diva who were passing through.

It's 25 years since we were last in Sri Lanka and while some things have changed (the roads have improved a lot!), the genuine warmth of the Sri Lankan people is the same It's always been.","Beautiful villa, stunning location, outstanding service.","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r937610915-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","728041130","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","1024","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/65/06/aa/mikeps5107ve.jpg","1280","0","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikepS5107VE","Mike P","0E0A171B2D94893B1CDCF85288903BF7",,,,,"mikepS5107VE"

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review and especially for considering your stay with us as being the best vacation of your life.
Our housekeeping team does a clean twice a day with a morning clean and an evening turndown service. We are especially fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihirpenna Beach on an acre plot of land. The villa was designed by the owner to take full advantage of the panoramic views of the Indian Ocean. When the weather permits, there are stilt fishermen directly infront of the villa and our Chefs purchase fresh fish from them. Sri Lanka has wonderful produce and it is especially important to our Chefs that they only use fresh, local produce in their recipes. They also only purchase from the local markets and fishermen directly to help our local community. 
We especially want to thank you for mentioning our entire team from our security guards, to our housekeepers, butlers, Chefs and managers. The whole team work very hard to ensure every one of our guests have a wonderful stay with us and leave with lovely memories so reading your review is very rewarding. 
We do hope to be able to welcome you back to Villa Sielen Diva in the future but in the meantime, please do keep intouch as we love hearing from past guests.
Kind regards,
The Sielen Diva Family","726533432","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","154","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","180","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","338","733","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","550","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","960","1365","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4e/05/38/caption.jpg","1024","726533431","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","150","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","154","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","180","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","338","733","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","550","1280","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","960","1365","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4e/05/37/caption.jpg","1024","726533430","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","1024","1056","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/4e/05/36/caption.jpg","1056",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd, Talpe 80615 Sri Lanka","Talpe","Sri Lanka","80615",," 776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd",,"15050754","5.998871","Talpe, Galle District, Southern Province","80.270584","Sielen Diva","195","5","2","0","1","6","186","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3198032-d15050754-Reviews-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.sielendiva.com/","2024-01-27","OTHER","5","Don't waste time on tours of you are staying at this place!

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review, we very much appreciate it. We are so happy you enjoyed your stay with us. We are very fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihirpenna Beach. Unfortunately we are unable to control the temperature of the pool being in a tropical country and January being one of the hottest months, the water does tend to be at its warmest during this time of year.  
The Aliya Suite is our largest Suite and very spacious with a king sized bed, chaise lounge, a large dining table and separate wardrobe and seating area. Being on the beach lawn with it's own private deck chairs in the front of the room makes it one of our most popular rooms. Unfortunately as we are directly infront of the beach and with the ocean breeze being strong, the beach lawn Suites do tend to often have the ocean breeze scent which some guests enjoy while others do not. We are so glad that after our team did another clean, you enjoyed your stay in the room. We are also glad you enjoyed the breakfast we offered and the service our team provided. 
Thank you for the feedback regarding the tea and coffee, we will most definitely take this into consideration. 
We do hope to be able to welcome you back to Villa Sielen Diva but in the meantime, please do keep intouch as we love hearing from past guests.

Able to walk down to the beach area and swim which was great. Pool was warm! Be nice if cooler.
Restaurants nearby. Walking along the beach or the very busy road.
Our villa room we had was huge, two big for two people! It smelt damp when we first arrived but once’s aired and also cleaned much better.
Breakfast was good.
Staff around helpful when asked. 
Lots of sun beds and clean towels. Plenty of places to sit out and be quiet.

The hotel is located on the beach front but you cannot actually go in the sea here due to the rocks. However there is a lovely secluded beach a little further to the right (approx 15 min walk along the beach). Alternatively, you can jump in a tuk tuk outside the hotel for a short ride to a number of beaches close by. 

On our first night we were the only couple eating at the hotel restaurant and had a delicious meal cooked for us. The food was always lovely especially the fresh seafood. We had breakfast & dinner there for the 3 days we stayed.

I recommend providing guests with more toiletries eg: shampoo and toothpaste.","Great experience and beautiful environment!","2024-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d1808812-r934284695-Era_Beach-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","452387885","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charinim2024","Charini M","3938E24B639DEC0A512781149A984BDC",,,,,"charinim2024"

The other staff are also brilliant, with the service always fast, and polite. Pasindu showed some great skills with the football when entertaining our kids. Everyone there was great with the kids and they absolutely loved the stay and were so sad to leave. The gentleman who cleaned the pool and the beach was amazing also. We enjoyed the new year celebrations a great deal. We recommend this property wholeheartedly and hope to go back soon. Thanks again to Sampath for arranging everything so well.

The staff were very helpful even before we arrived, helping to book a car from the airport.  It is a two hour drive form the airport but the roads are very good and there is lots to look at on the way. On arrival you can relax with a drink and admire the scenery.  The site is not large, it is based on 9 lodge type rooms around a pool and a few metres from the beach and behind a wall and gatehouse to separate it from the road.  There is a bar/restaurant as well.
The room was large, the bed was large and very comfortable and had a mosquito net around the bed but we didn’t find insects much of a problem here.  The bathroom was large and had a bath and a rain shower with hot water at any time.  There was nice smelling shampoo, conditioner and shower gel.  The air con was brilliant.  The room we had was concrete based, but it was tastefully decorated and was comfortable with a lounge area, desk and table.  There were two wardrobes, a safe and a fridge.  No TV and the internet was sketchy so get a Sri Lankan SIM for your phone data if you will miss these.  We did a lot of reading and playing games so didn’t notice the lack of TV.  It was nice to not watch the news.  Bottled water is topped up regularly.
The food is wonderful.  You will not have food from a freezer and microwave, it has to be ordered in good time which you get used to.  Food is made in the kitchens to a high standard.  Breakfast is huge and we couldn’t eat it all so picked items to order after the first day.  There is a large menu with lots of choice for meals during the day and evening.  I am a vegetarian and my husband is not and this can be a problem on holiday but we found the food excellent and the variety kept us interested.  Lots of national dishes to try.  There is a well stocked bar as well.
The staff are friendly and try hard to help with any queries you may have, they helped us order a tuk tuk for the first time, they helped us find a pharmacy and made us very early breakfasts when we needed to go out on tours.  There is a turndown service and they clean your room everyday if you wish.  We did to get more water and towels and for an expert to sort our mosquito net.
The grounds are kept very clean by two staff who work hard all day to pick up leaves, fruit and flowers that inevitably fall from the trees in site.  They also keep the beach area clean in front of the hotel.  It is the best area of beach for some distance either way for lack of rubbish and detritus.
You cannot swim in the sea directly next to the hotel but the waves and sand and a paddle were enough with the warm pool to swim in.  It is long enough to get some good lengths done.  You can walk to other beach areas but for the effort, heat and rubbish you will see on the way you should probably stay at the hotel.
Overall, we had a lovely time and would gladly come back for another stay.  For overall relaxation, food and friendliness this hotel is now one of our favourites. 
The only downside that we found was that the mattress was not as clean as it could have been and should really be replaced.","Relaxing, hot and excellent food","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d983489-r944222186-The_Frangipani_Tree_by_Edwards_Collection-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","452390706","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","0","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg?w=100&h=100&s=1","0","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","50","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","150","200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","180","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","205","450","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","450","550","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","550","1024","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1024","1200","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","8","22","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710jcg","J C G","0D06678D6746C391337086F3D74C52BA",,,,,"710jcg"

It was also the end-most room so no-one needed to walk past to get to their room (not that were many people staying anyway!) but it was still only one minute walk from the central/bar/dining building. There was a huge (semi-covered) outdoor bathroom / courtyard, with a big freestanding bathtub and separate shower.

The thorough and diligent housekeeping and maintenance team keep all rooms, outside spaces and pool absolutely immaculate.

Regrettably you can't swim directly in front of the hotel as the beach shelves steeply with strong currents, however you can scramble over some rocks and head 500 metres or so westwards where there is a tiny beach cafe and a safer area to swim. The hotel has a lovely pool, long enough for length swimming, with more loungers set alongside.

Desk and chair provided in room would serve as an ideal dressing table, however there was no mirror or socket near it!

WiFi effective across the site.

“All-day” food menu covers most tastes at typical hotel prices. Breafast choice of English, Indian or Sri Lankan (try egg hoppers with fish curry for breakfast - delicious!). Wine seems expensive in most hotels in Sri Lanka compared with UK/EU prices, here being similar. Food is good and tasty (although curry & rice seemed rather “westernised” and not at all spicy), service is leisurely, but everything is cooked to order and we were in no hurry! They will ask you for your dinner order during the course of the day, and your breakfast order before you retire at night. If you wish you can opt to have meals served at your own patio table.

Staff English speaking seems quite limited, but we didn't have any issues with this. Nearly all of our food and drink service was provided by the very kind and helpful frontman Dammika.

Sunsets overlooking the ocean with a cocktail or a beer were beautiful.

Overall this is a small, well kept, quiet total relaxation place, with the crashing waves as background, only occasionally overriden by a tooting horn to remind you there's a busy road and a world outside the high front wall. There's little or nothing to do other than relax, which suited us just nicely for a few days R&R at the end of a long, busy tour of Sri Lanka. In fact as the hotel occupancy was low during our stay it had the rather exclusive feel of a gated private villa!

Nearby: If you want to step outside the hotel there's little or nothing worth walking to, and it's a busy main road, but dozens of tuk-tuks ply this road so we grabbed one (cost Rs 1000) to visit nearby Unawatuna, which has a big, clean, safe-for-swimming sandy beach, with plenty of beachfront bars and cafes with sunbeds (some free if you eat/drink there).
